On its face it is very stupid, but it's *intentionally* very stupid and gets more and more stupid as the runtime goes on. The audience is along for the same ride that the characters are on, experiencing the global deceleration that affects everyone's minds and causes the complete breakdown of civilization.\n\nThe scene with JT singing The Killers is an important one to examine with this lens, that we the audience are on the same 'journey' his character is. When he first injects the drug, he swells with euphoria and pride in what makes him feel like \"him,\" namely that sort of fuck yeah America nationalism. But as the initial high wears off, it all sort of melts away into what he actually feels - a desperate need to escape from the status quo he feels trapped in, and a need to numb himself against his crumbling identity and existential crisis. In this way I think that the last 30 seconds of the scene are more thematically important than the musical number itself, which is a sort of smokescreen to what JT's character is really feeling. He uses the drug that is extracted from the same process that is causing the global deceleration - a microcosmic version of what's happening to the rest of the world in his own personal crisis.\n\nI really think it's a secret genius kind of movie, and every stupid detail is quite intentional. Intentionally stupid, but intentional. It's one of those movies that I'm scared to share with my friends because I worry they won't 'get' it, but there is definitely more to this movie than meets the eye.",

A drummer of Teller's character's skill would be able to at least just \"play time.\" Maybe miss an accent or two, but it wouldn't be a total disaster, and he certainly wouldn't be frozen and completely unable to play. \n\nThere were lots of other musical inaccuracies throughout. I didn't go to *that* sort of music school, but I've been adjacent to that world for much of my life, and I was left utterly flummoxed at how wrong some of it seemed to me. \n\nBut on the other hand, the whole overarching premise, where a controlling, abusive asshole is in charge of a music ensemble or program? Yeah, that's friggin' accurate. I almost got PTSD flashbacks to two particular directors from my past.",

It also reduces the impact of a lot of what we see because we can say to ourselves \"this part probably isn't real\"\n\nI thought the opening scene was great, right into it with an interesting approach to the problem...then they took their foot off the gas. \n\nI'm interested to see what happens in the next film, I hope they take it bigger and wider and don't just focus on one person who was in the audience.

The love story ending abruptly kind of goes with the theme of 'growing up', that there would be many women in his life and that was one of many. In the DC, the future Toto stuff focuses too much on resolving that romance plot and kind of just hurts the movie and drags it down. Roger Ebert addressed this in his re-review where as while he believed the movie was always a 4/4, Weinstein was right to trim down the film and recommended people just look for the theatrical if they really wanted to watch the movie.\n\n[https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/cinema-paradiso-the-new-version-2002](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/cinema-paradiso-the-new-version-2002)\n\n>Seeing the longer version is a curious experience. It is an item of faith that the director of a film is always right, and that studios who cut films are butchers. Yet I must confess that the shorter version of \"Cinema Paradiso\" is a better film than the longer. Harvey was right. The 170-minute cut overstays its welcome, and continues after its natural climax.\n\n>Still, I'm happy to have seen it--not as an alternate version, but as the ultimate exercise in viewing deleted scenes. Anyone who loves the film will indeed be curious about \"what really happened to the love of a lifetime,\" and it is good to know. I hope, however, that this new version doesn't replace the old one on the video shelves",

        "comment_body": "Isn't the \"director's cut\" essentially the version the entire rest of the world saw, and the \"theatrical cut\" is the version that the Weinsteins chopped up for U.S. audiences?\n\nI've noticed that people who see the shorter version first tend to view the added scenes as unnecessary because they already liked the movie without it. But I think there's a decent chance that if you traveled back in time and watched the director's cut first, you would be horrified to hear that the Weinsteins wanted to cut an hour out.\n\nI actually didn't care much for the movie, so I don't really have a horse in this race, but I seriously doubt the Weinsteins did a better cut than Tornatore did. It's more accessible, which means more people are going to like it, and that means there will be a number of people who like the short one but not the long one, but that doesn't mean that's the best version of the movie.\n\nEdit: Looks like there are actually *three* versions. It used to be 155 minutes when it was released in Italy, then the Weinsteins cut it down to 124 for international release, and then the director's cut/\"Cinema Paradiso: The New Version\" is 173 (although this is technically the \"original version\" since it's the one that played at the premiere).",

He would release, in short order, *Vertigo*, *Rear Window*, *North By Northwest*, *Psycho*, and *The Birds*.  Not one, not two, but *five* films that many consider all time best works\u2026 and that\u2019s ignoring some *all time best* works he had in the decades prior to this!\n\nBut after *The Birds* Hitchcock seemed to hit the proverbial wall.  His next film after *The Birds* was *Marnie* and while there are those who are fans of it, many felt it was a muddled misfire.  It seemed from that point on Hitchcock was kinda lost.  The films that followed, *Torn Curtain*, *Topaz*, *Frenzy*, and, finally, *Family Plot* had their moments but compared to what came immediately before them, they are viewed as much lesser works.\n\nTimes changed, for sure, for Hitchcock.  You had the hippie revolution.  You had Vietnam.  Things weren\u2019t the same in society and it seemed that, in part, had Hitchcock searching -but failing- to connect with audiences.  Many feel of those last few films, *Frenzy* -his only \u201cR\u201d rated work- was his best but even still I don\u2019t feel it comes close to his very best works of *The Birds* and before.  His final film, *Family Plot*, was an amusing but light dark comedy and that was that.\n\nFor Alex Proyas, it seemed his time in the sun lasted far less, two films, but at least he had \u2018em!",

I truly loved it.\n\nIs it a perfect movie? Not at all - but the sheer reverence for not only the stage musical but also The Wizard of Oz film is instantly apparent. I also found the sound mix and the arrangements of songs to be very well done. \n\nHonestly my biggest critique is that Bowen Yang pulls focus in literally every scene he\u2019s in, but even that is preferred to me than your average blockbuster with standard Marvel humor. \n\nIf the stage musical has any sort of special place in your heart you\u2019ll enjoy this adaptation. \n\nAlso this will make a billion dollars without breaking a sweat.",

Considering there is a sitting US senator drinking with Col. Johnston at the end of the movie. Also the senator implies he is not the only one in the pocket of oil companies who asked for the \"issue\" of people \"squatting\" on the lands taken care of. \n\nMr Rate is observant.  Plus Swagger is subject of a nation wide manhunt.  His face will be plastered every where.  \n\nRate realizes that the cold bore shot wasn't taken by Swagger. He realizes that it was by the other person who could have taken that shot.  The Serbian shooter who was in the wheelchair.  The goat they staked out to draw Swagger in later in the movie. NB: a cold bore shot refers to taking a shot from a 'cold bore' meaning the first round fired from a clean barrel.  So while it is the most accurate due to no particulate matter fouling the barrel from subsequent shots, it is the one that you have the least information about.  The first shot may miss and you can adjust for the following shots.  So being able to shoot cold bore accurately is a feat. \n\nRate's comment about it being a bad job is 'speaking from experience'  He knows that a job such as this, the patsy must be killed to ensure there is no way to lead back to the people actually behind the job.  You hire someone to either do the job or do the work so they can be framed.  The job gets done.  You kill the person; random mugging, car accident, slip and fall down stairs.  The investigation ends with that death.  case close.\n\nSwagger is asking if Rate knows of anyone else who has the skill to successfully shoot that shot.  see point 4.\n\nThe bullet was matched by its composition.  The metals/alloys that comprise the bullet.  Normally you would try to match the bullet to the firearm by matching the burn/wear pattern that the bullet has when fired out of the firearm.  So you take the bullet you recover from the scene of the crime.  You take the firearm you think took the shot.  You fire a couple of test rounds.  If the groove patterns match. You have the right firearm.    In this case, the round was so badly mangled they cant see anything that could help them match a round fired out of the firearm in question.\n\nSwagger burns the recording because once the senator implies that he is one of many people in this conspiracy.  Swagger understands that them having it puts a target on their back.  While he alone can probably disappear.  Sara and Nick do not have the skill, habits, nor mindset needed to survive being hunted by large multinational companies who have no issues in hiring PMCs and importing foreign military units into the home nation's border to eliminate threats.  By destroying the evidence, he is declaring to the senator and the others by proxy that they just want out.  If they kept it, they would be hunted until the evidence is destroyed.  If they handed it over to the FBI, with the contacts and reach that the senator implied; the tape would have been destroyed and they would have been disappeared.   nb: this is also a gamble.  they could have been killed after they destroyed the tape.  that is what most likely would have happened if it wasnt a movie.",

That was a much higher budget than both Gladiator ($103m) and Revenge of the Sith ($113m), to put it into perspective. \n\nThe real question would have been, why keep him on? You could have potentially done so with a full reboot but Brosnan still had an old school debonair style that only worked a certain way.\n\nCasino Royale ended up making a lot more money and effectively revitalized a moribund franchise that had become an Austin Powers laughingstock. It was a good choice to move on.\n\nI do feel like there\u2019s a clear open door now for a triumphant Brosnan return as Old Bond, though, if they don\u2019t want to do the normal recasting.",

They likely thought that doing a complete tone change yet keeping the same actor would have felt weird and disconnected.  Starting over with a new tone they figured a new actor would be better for it.  The Mission Impossible and Jason Bourne movies made the 007 movies look like a relic at the time.  The bond movies looked campy in comparison in many people's eyes.     Really action films in general had change some of their tone cause even xXx was doing some real stunts while Brosnan was surfing a giant CGI wave or hiding behind an invisible car.  \n\nThe James Bond movies needed a complete tone shift to keep up with the trend or sit it out and wait for their style of films to come back.  They went with a tone change and it worked for them financially.  A lot of people still missed some of the campy spy stuff which is why The Kingsman movies did well.",

        "comment_body": "Love this version (despite the \"born sexy yesterday\" trope) because it's such a good old-fashioned adventure story. There's not a single \"quip\" in this movie; it just allows itself to be what it is. It's fun.\n\nI also think it is really interesting that this is one of the few time-travel movies\u2020 where the protagonist goes *forward* from his time instead of backwards. What's even more interesting is that he doesn't even seem to consider going backwards as an idea at all. In fact, the only time he goes back in time is to actually go to the \"future\" of his original starting point by one week \u2013just to tell his friends about his trip. \n\nThe way the film handles time-travel makes this story similar in some ways to interplanetary fantasies, except we are always aware that this is Earth and there are ramifications for what Earth has become as opposed to just being some off-world adventure. \n\nRegardless, I think it demonstrates something about Wells as a writer that he'd prefer to imagine the future rather than try to \"fix\" the past as well as demonstrating something about writers who do the opposite. Of course, it's definitely easier to write a story about traveling to the past since all you have to do is open a history book and you've got your basic storyline framework laid out in front of you as opposed to having to imagine a whole new history that hasn't happened yet as well as the new world produced by it. But it speaks to Wells' imagination which does not tolerate or allow cynicism. And I say that knowing full well that the future he envisioned was full of war, death, cannibalism and murder. I just think the story itself is still full of hope and wonder about the future.\n\nAlso, we have to give credit to Wells intelligence that he chose not to set the tale at some point anyone reading it will likely ever be living. According to the wiki, the traveller travels 800K years into the future. There's no chance that anyone will ever read it at that time and say \"Look at what people back then thought the world was going to be like now!\" Smart move.\n\n\u2020The other famous time-forward travel movie of course is 1968's Planet of the Apes, the audience just didn't know it was a time-travel movie until the end.\n\nEdit: Thought of another one. Idiocracy is also a movie with time travelers going to the future.",

Sister James was born and raised in the Bronx and is of Irish Catholic ancestry, and she explains that when her brother fell ill, it wasn't acknowledged or talked about. They got him treatment but it was almost brushed under the rug, like so many problems in an Irish Catholic family -- there was no therapy or talking openly about things -- all that pain was internalized. \n\nIt's meant to be a parallel to the Catholic church's ignoring and even covering up the problems they had with all the abuse going on. And much like the eventual outcome of families and individuals internalizing all of their pain and problems, it was almost the ruin of the church.\n\nIt's also important to note that I have neither seen the movie nor the play, nor is any of the above true. I made it all up out of thin air and nobody is probably reading this far. I like turtles.",

        "comment_body": "I don't think there is any file manager that supports both file storage and data analysis like you want. But I can suggest a way for you to do it that is similar to what I do.\nFirst you come up with an organisation system that is most suited to you. For me I prefer grouping films by director, then language. I create a folder for every director whom I consider noteworthy and who has made more than one film. The films that don't go into the director folders go into the language folder. I don't like categorising between genre because there is often cross genre bleeding.\n\nNow this system itself is enough for me. Since storage space will always be limited, I only keep the films that I've already watched and might want to go back to again, and that are not easily available on streaming platforms. Any film that I want to watch, I can locate using this system off the top of my head.\n\nAnother system that I thought of, but didn't implement because it was a lot of work, was to dump all the films in one giant folder, and have an excel sheet in which I would log each film I put in. The excel sheet would have columns like Director, language, genre, and any other data I would want to have, and also I would put a hyperlink for the film at the end column. It's relatively simple to organise rows on excel using filters, so one can categorise the films any way they  want, and also pull up the file itself using the hyperlink. This system even allows you to log films that you don't have in your collection. And you can even link to Wikipedia.\n\nBut the thing is, I never saw the point of it. All the information I could want is easily available on Wikipedia and letterboxd. And when it comes to file organisation, for me simplicity is above all.",

Griffith, 1930);\u00a0 not the 1938 Cary Grant/Katherine Hepburn re-make.\u00a0 Both versions are good, but the earlier one emphasizes the unspoken (mostly) romance more.\u00a0 I also prefer Ann Harding over Hepburn in the role of Linda. \u00a0\n* ***The V.I.P.s*** (Anthony Asquith, 1963);\u00a0 the main romance involves Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, but it\u2019s the secondary plot/romance with Maggie Smith and Rod Taylor that is really special, and that is the stronger narrative, mostly due to Dame Maggie (no surprise there).\n* ***The Shop Around The Corner*** (Ernst Lubitsch, 1940);\u00a0 the film that *You\u2019ve Got Mail* was based on;\u00a0 Margaret Sullavan had the charm that Meg Ryan didn\u2019t really deliver in the remake.\u00a0 The classic \u2018enemies to lovers\u2019 trope.\n\n*Edited to add: a copy and paste of a comment I made in another thread.*\n\n* ***Sunday in New York***\u00a0(Peter Tewksbury, 1963);\u00a0 my favorite Jane Fonda movie; a bit studio-bound (not surprising given that it was based on a stage play), and thematically dated, but the chemistry between Fonda and Rod Taylor works;\u00a0 superior to the better-known,\u00a0*Barefoot in the Park,* where Fonda is paired with Robert Redford (and where I don't detect much chemistry).\u00a0\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Not in the category of postponed romance:**\n\n* ***Remember the Night*** (Mitchell Leisen, 1940);\u00a0 by far, my favorite Preston Sturges film not directed by Sturges (he wrote it);\u00a0 the chemistry between the leads (Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray) is actually convincing, unlike Sturges\u2019 better know films.

We received so many responses like, \u201cWe love the film, but we cannot do anything with it or we\u2019ll lose our shirts. We\u2019re sorry.\u201d The intervention comes from people like Laemmle/Zeller Films. Every couple of years, some mavericks take on this challenge of distributing so-called un-distributable films. They take those films on a small run and allow them to see the light of day. Those efforts are what give a film like\u00a0Down to the Bone\u00a0a chance to have a life of some kind.\"\n\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20060413142519/https://www.filmmakermagazine.com/archives/online_features/cutting_close.php",

And Vivian mentions that Warner is never sent to get Callahan his coffee, only the girls, showing he's a bit of a misogynist.\n\nAnother good example of this - not a movie, but relevant - is the Midsomer Murders episode \"Ghosts of Christmas Past\" where the killer is ever-present and always in the audience's conscious mind, but so beneath notice that you probably don't even consider them a suspect at all until the last few minutes of the episode, when all the clues come together and the final, decisive clue comes about to Barnaby that he solves the case.\n\nIn fact, the other suspects can't even believe that the killer was >!the friend that their elderly aunt invited over for Christmas that year!< until the end... but after the entire investigation and the how and who of the case are laid out to them, they remark that it does make perfect sense, because a recurring plot point which has been overshadowing events in the house suddenly makes a ton of sense.\n\nAfter all, >!it was mentioned that Claire English was divorced, so if she had a sibling, they'd have different surnames!<.",

He fantasized about her for ages, automatically assuming she was his dream girl, before he ever managed to build enough rapport to have a genuine conversation with her. This ends up being one of the root flaws in their relationship. She was being fairly transparent about who she was, what she was looking for, and what she was about, but he wasn't listening, too caught up in the idea of her instead of really trying to understand the person and evaluate objectively if they were a good fit. \n\nWe have no idea how things will go with Autumn but right away we see a completely different approach, he's more direct and he's looking right at her as she demonstrates aspects of her character. I think this is the real change in season that has happened, whether things work out with Autumn or not doesn't matter, his approach is much more suited to actually finding a good match and in practical terms achieving the relationship he had previously just fantasized about.",

But as the war went on and ground down both sides, that philosophy went away. The true \u201cbad guy\u201d was imperialism and Europe\u2019s political scheme that lead to the outbreak of war. \n\nWWII in comparison is much more morally concrete. It was obvious that the guys doing the conquest and genocide were the bad guys. Is easier to tell a compelling story in that context of good vs evil.",

Let me explain.\n\nThe central theme of the movie is making peace with life\u2019s endings and disappointments. And the story is full of shitty endings: Picard\u2019s family dies offscreen in a pointless tragedy. The Enterprise-D, the coolest ship in the Galaxy, gets taken out by an old Bird-of-Prey with a cheap trick. Data finally gets emotions and they *suck.* One guy drops a bridge on Captain freaking Kirk. \n\nTime is the fire in which we burn, and we burn without any promised purpose or lasting glory.\n\nBut the argument of the movie is that this shitty reality full of let downs is still beautiful and more meaningful than the idealized illusion offered by the Nexus. In spite of everything, the little victories make it all worth it. Picard\u2019s legacy lives on in his actions if not his family name. Kirk and the Enterprise fall in the defence of innocent lives. Data\u2019s emotions are one step closer to humanity. It\u2019s enough.\n\nOn a personal note, I\u2019m reaching an age where I\u2019m making peace with the fact that my life will probably eventually end without, say, my own Wikipedia page. And maybe Generations was helpful in accepting that. It\u2019s okay to not go out like a legend if you do your best.\n\nIf nothing else, it was fun.",

Despite being a solid rock musician, Dewey is a little bit naive and probably got so excited about the kids talent that he forgot he actually needed to prepare something original for them to play. And when Summer asks what his song is he realizes he looks ridiculous not having anything and proceeds to make it up. We don\u2019t really know if he did any songwriting prior to this and it\u2019s definitely possible he doesn\u2019t have originals of his own to play. \n\nWhile making it up, however, he starts to get really into it. When he\u2019s singing the \u201cyou\u2019re not hardcore\u201d part you can tell he\u2019s enjoying himself and starting to get attached to the song. So I guess it would make sense that he remembered it after that and teaches it to the kids later.",

It\u2019s more like the image we all have of the ninja came long after the fact.

Ninja probably *existed*, at least as people who specialized in a certain set of tactics, but the actual history is deeply murky and has long been associated with mystical folktales and children's stories (which is still the case in Japan).\n\nThe media-fed \"ninja boom\" of the 1980s was mostly the result of two, shall we say \"highly imaginative\" martial artists - Masaaki Hatsumi and Stephen K. Hayes - repopularizing the ninja mystique in Japan and introducing it to the USA, respectively.  There had been earlier outliers in Western pop-culture - ninja are fairly prominent in the James Bond mythos, though only via *You Only Live Twice* \\- but the other cultural conditions weren't right to establish a craze. \n\nDuring the '80s (importantly, once the kung fu movie craze of the 1970s had firmly established Asian martial arts in Western pop-culture) American audiences, especially, fell in love with the idea of the ninja. It was then a quick journey through *Enter the Ninja* movies to the *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles* franchise to plastic ninja Halloween costumes.\n\nSo, one answer is that \"ninja\" have not been taken especially seriously in Japanese culture over the past, say, 200 years, and at the time the classic samurai movies were being produced (1950s-'60s) the ninja were really associated more with comic books and supernatural folktales than with real history. Thus, the lack of serious films, etc. was for much the same reason that superhero stories weren't treated seriously in the West during that period.",

Cosmic dread at its finest.\n\nKill List - Starts as a hitman film, spirals into this absolutely bonkers folk horror ritual nightmare. Seriously unsettling.\n\nApostle - Folk horror with cult vibes that\u2019ll make your skin crawl. Real supernatural menace that feels ancient and malevolent.\n\nResolution/The Endless - Subtle cosmic horror that\u2019ll break your brain. Lovecraftian vibes without relying on cheap tricks.\n\nThe Ritual - Nordic folklore horror with that primordial evil feeling similar to The Void. Absolutely devastating psychological terror.\n\nBonus mentions for that deep Southern occult atmosphere: Skeleton Key (which you already know), and some deeper cuts like The House of the Dead for genuine voodoo creepiness.\n\nThese aren\u2019t jump-scare trash - they\u2019re the kind of horror that gets under your skin and makes you feel like something ancient is watching.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b",

Principal photography for the LoTR movies was halfway done when Gladiator released so it seems dubious at best. There were later reshoots so it's not impossible I guess, but are you actually basing this on anything specific or just making an assumption?",

Still, the self-hatred was the same. \n\nThe worst scene was probably the fight in the apartment. It was so vicious and seemingly endless, it actually made me cover my face and plead with the TV to \" please, stop\". \n\nI love this movie.

That scene was so damn real and she did it in exactly the same order I'd usually do it until there is nothing left but to self destruct and give up.\n\nAside from Blair Waldorf staring at the fridge or at food in Gossip Girl and Charly slowly dying in The Whale it's the most real depiction of ED and self esteem issued I've experienced in a movie. It's weirdly liberating to see it on screen.\n\nI abslotely recommend the movie to everyone I know. Beautiful cinematography despite the violence and the devil is in the less gory details.

Maybe also putting \"Disney\" front and center did some damage - they were trying to find the next Pirates franchise and had several non-starters.\n\nAlso the film could've used a little more Bryan Cranston - that came out in the middle of the Breaking Bad hype and they didn't really give him much to do or feature him in the trailers.

Tik tok got big even with a hundred soc media apps around. As long as your implementation is good and you offer something new and not gimmicky you're good.\n\nMaybe don't start it off as a social media site, more like a place to curate discourse around movies in one place from different sites like reddit, Twitter, letterboxd and youtube \n\nFor example, if the user has just watched a popular movie that was released in 2017, show  some tweets and recommend videos about said movie from around the time the movie came out, to experience the discourse and commentary as if it was fresh. \n\nLike for example after finishing breaking bad I wanted to check out breaking bad related tweets from 2013 to see what people's reactions were when it first came out. A site that would curate all of this instead of me having to use the advanced search feature on twitter manually would've been cool. \n\nWhat's your tech stack? Do you plan on paying for APIs or just using the free tier? Is the twitter api's free version good enough for use right now?\n\nGood luck!",

But honestly the movie has *a lot* of plot points that don't really add up if you think about them.\u00a0\n\n\nThe premise as a whole is very shaky to say the least. It doesn't take place nearly far enough in the future for the judicidial system to seemingly have abandoned all the characteristics it has in modern society. How did we go from a modern court system to one where a single agency highly controlled by a single guy can dictate who is guilty? Not only is it such an obviously fallible single control point, but did politics and bureaucracy just disappear? People IRL don't even trust vaccines that have been used for 100 years, but everyone trusts 3 weirdos in a pool seeing the future? Sure.\n\n\nThe plot also has similar issues. Every adversity is easily solved with too simple solutions. Tom Cruise's character is wanted but literally walks into the Precrime facility, who is apparently so unguarded he literally has time to steal one of the Precogs. He's arrested and his average civilian wife easily rescues him. He needs to expose the bad guy and there's a direct link from a completely different location to the big screen at the party?\n\n\nThen the ending is the villain being given a choice between discrediting the invention he's literally killed to protect or going to jail... And he picks a 3rd option that's literally the worst of both worlds from his perspective. Yeah, yeah, it's thematically fitting because he decides his own future, but his motivations make zero sense.\n\n\nHonestly the whole movie feels like a dream. No wonder the theories that claim the main guy is actually sedated in jail dreaming his fantasy story are so popular.",

        "comment_body": "I agree with the other takes that it's not a horror movie. Even so, this is a intensely *creepy* take on the crime that is central to the Plato's cave allegory.\n\nI've always seen that what was done to Truman is an act of monstrous depravity and that the Christof character played by Ed Harris is a ghoulish villain. \n\nI'm not sure how many viewers see it this way. It may be that the [final scene where Truman discovers the exit door can be misread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_zYn-HHcyA). The uplifting music and release of emotional tension makes it possible to misinterpret it as a happy ending.\n\nHowever, the camera focuses not so much on Truman \u2014 whose human spirit leads him to leave the false cave where he's been imprisoned \u2014 but instead on his captors and torturers. \n\nWe see Christof makes one last cruel attempt to keep the horror going, falsely telling Truman that the \"real world\" is no better than the fake world. We see the craven and dimwitted television audience cheer for the person they've exploited for decades, and then, mere seconds later, stupidly search for the next distraction.\n\nIt's a devastating ending, so much so that I think some people resist it and instead prefer to see it as a happy, feel-good ending because Truman escaped. We're certainly happy for Truman to be free, but I think the happy ending interpretation fails to register how exploitative, cruel, and fundamentally evil it was to keep him imprisoned in the first place. \n\nTo me, the feel-bad ending is stern condemnation of the human weakness for celebrity worship, mass delusion, and cultural rot.",

So she wakes up every day thinking she's still 25, but time ages her, so eventually she wakes up thinking she's 25, but she looks in the mirror and can see she's 60, she would freak out, so one way or another, she needs some sort of explanation every morning, something to catch her up on her condition, notes to explain that she has amnesia and that actually her life goes on but she doesn't remember it. \n\nSo she has the choice between waking up every day to explanations about her condition and doing nothing with her life except getting older and reading these explanations and thinking \"well fair enough, I couldn't do any of my dreams because I have this condition so that makes many things impossible\".... OR she can discuss her plans with her husband every day including having children and living on a boat and she can make meticulous notes to be able to follow her progress towards her goals even though every day she has to be caught up on where she is on the way to achieving these goals.\n\nMaybe it's weird to wake up pregnant but she's amnesiac anyway, then she finds her notes that catch her up on everything she's been doing and that this is her plan. And she's still the same person every day despite her amnesia so we can assume her goals remain the same once she has some time to get back into it.",

Why pay a subscription if you have to pay again for anything new and decent?\n\n\nI don't know what success Disney+ had with it, but I assume it wasn't great because it seems like very few movies use that model. Most likely that's because if it's in theatres anyone who's desperate to see it will go there and if it's gone straight to streaming you've basically sacrificed the cinema revenue for streaming revenue. The streaming revenue will likely be lower because people are paying near-cinema prices without the cinema experience, resulting in lower demand since people know it'll be free in a month or so anyway. I think the only reason Disney does it is the hope it will draw people to the platform, so they're willing to sacrifice some short term movie revenue for the hope they'll gain subscribers long term.",

Think about the black and white opening sequence of Casino Royale, or how some movies like Hurt Locker shot on 16mm. They are aesthetic choices. The concern for 35mm though is that if production numbers fall below a certain threshold, then the developers needed to process the film might not be able to sustain their businesses and just shut down.\n\nDigital capture is the new normal, post-production workflows would assume digital capture nowadays and would have to adjust their pipeline if a production told them to expect film rushes.\n\nThe reality is that digital is far easier to use, much easier to get immediate feedback, with full-res playback once the take is finished (rather than waiting for rushes the next day), can shoot in a wider range of conditions, and capable of higher resolution than celluloid. Studios will prefer this convenience every time, unless you can make a case that film is more appropriate as an aesthetic. And even then, software and plugins exist that can allow an editor/colorist to grade footage to mimic film, including halation, gate weave and exposure response.",

Anymore than we\u2019re going back to VHS camcorders in the age of cell phones. \n\nThat being said celluloid still is maintained by niche photographers and that\u2019s an active community. The problem with movies is the ecosystem. It\u2019s one thing to take photographs on film but movies require an industry to pull off. You need thousands of feet of film. Someone has to make that. Currently it\u2019s only Kodak and they only do it basically at a loss. Then it has to be processed and there aren\u2019t many places to do that anymore either.  \n\nThen the other issue is that you now have an entire generation of filmmakers who only know how to do things digitally. Everyone lives in a what you see is what you get world now and no one wants to wait a few days for dailies to come back from the lab. And it\u2019s not just the creatives themselves. If you\u2019re a director and you want to shoot a commercial on film you\u2019ll get laughed out of the room by the ad agency. The people who hire you don\u2019t even have a clue of how to shoot on film anymore. There\u2019s a rekindled interest in young filmmakers who want to do their student projects or passion projects on film. But this is largely due to them wanting to capture what they grew up with. But in another generation no one will have any nostalgia for the 90s or early 2000s visuals. They will only know digital. Just like kids today don\u2019t really have any nostalgia for CDs because they\u2019ve only grown up with music being streamed. \n\nI don\u2019t think film will truly die for super high end stuff. Spielberg, Nolan and Tarantino will likely be able to finish their careers shooting exclusively on film. But the feature film ecosystem for shooting on celluloid is not favorable to any sort of renaissance.",

The rest is history.\n\nThey might do it working for a studio.

These companies are also often connected to the management teams of the actor, like I think Plan B for instance actually shared offices with his management firm, or they did when I was around. Also, these people have a personal assistant (can be a very serious job, like a CEO\u2019s executive assistant), an accountant and maybe a bookkeeper too, and there\u2019s probably family that need jobs, and they all need an office to work in.

Not everything of cultural significance is \"good, actually\".\n\nIf I had to name ten films that you'd need to have watched to embed yourself in an English language cultural landscape, I would go with:\n\n* Jurassic Park\n* Forrest Gump\n* The Fugitive\n* the Harry Potter films collectively -- but particularly the first two\n* Schindler's List\n* the first three Indiana Jones movies\n* Home Alone and Love, Actually\n* The Lion King (1994)\n* some Bond films -- I suggest the following sampling: Diamonds Are Forever, Moonraker, GoldenEye, Die Another Day, Casino Royale and Skyfall\n\nIf I was to add another ten films I would go with:\n\n* Batman Begins\n* Die Hard, Die Hard 3 and Die Hard 4.0\n* Spider-Man\n* Twilight\n* Enemy of the State\n* Con Air\n* Toy Story\n* The Christopher Reeves Superman movies\n* Saving Private Ryan\n* Snow White (the original Disney movie)\n\nIf I was to add another ten films I would go with:\n\n* The Wind in the Willows (any adaptation will do but [I'd prioritise this one](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0787244/)\n* any Sherlock Holmes movie (my personal suggestion: Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows)\n* Transformers\n* Sleeping Beauty (any adaptation will do)\n* Pay it Forward\n* The Bourne Trilogy\n* Shrek and Shrek 2\n* Hot Fuzz\n* Back to the Future\n* any Murder on the Orient Express\n\nand now I'll suggest some films I suspect anyone reading this would be asking, \"Seriously, how is that not here?\" in a fourth tranche:\n\n* Rogue One\n* The Shawshank Redemption\n* A Few Good Men\n* Primal Fear\n* Sicario and Sicario: Day of the Soldado\n* Pulp Fiction \n* Inception\n* Whiplash\n* Finding Nemo\n* Zootopia\n* An American Tail\n\nThere is a distinct weakness when it comes to horror movies and Westerns but those are very niche genres, imo. Additionally, Twilight is a notoriously highly specific kind of a vampire movie. There's a distinct lack of Westerns, Mob movies, Alien Invasions, Heist Movies and Zombie films so let's try and correct that:\n\n* Logan Lucky\n* Shanghai Noon\n* Inside Man\n* Men in Black, Men in Black II and Men in Black III\n* Independence Day\n* Army of the Dead\n* Zombieland\n* Goodfellas\n* Layer Cake\n* Interview With The Vampire\n\nAnd there's also a sports, teen/school and war movie weakness so in the final tranche, I will suggest:\n\n* Cars and  A Knight's Tale\n* Field of Dreams and Moneyball\n* Platoon, Black Hawk Down,  Jarhead and Zero Dark Thirty\n* The Eagle Has Landed, The Great Escape and 1917\n* Mean Girls, Easy A, Heathers and Grease\n* American Dreamz, Sing and Pitch Perfect\n* Music and Lyrics, Four Weddings and Funeral and Bridget Jones' Diary\n* John Q\n* Peter Pan (Disney) followed by Hook\n* Christmas with the Kranks",

I haven't necessarily seen all of these films and some of the ones I have seen I don't like, but conceptually I don't think that matters. Similarly, while I've tried to think mainly of movies which are well known and generally liked, in some cases I think that lesser known films better reveal the preoccupations of the Anglosphere. You will note an extreme bias towards American movies. This, I think, is realistic. On the other hand, trying and capture how the contemporary English speaker thinks about Things is... ambitious, even if I give myself 250 films to work with.\n\nI would consider this to be a watch order, yes.\n\n**1.

I often ran into issues with not so much my friends but friends' parents not wanting their kids to be around my mum and by extension me. I'm not proud of it, but I lied a lot about my home life, and my mum on occasion encouraged it so that I wasn't excluded. I remember my friend and I lying to their parents about my mum and my mum sending her GF away for the weekend so that a friend could stay without their parents being weird. \n\nIt's very hard to understand something like that unless you've been there and are aware of the very real consequences of something out of yours and your parents who love dearly's control.",

Remember, it came out in the 90s and things were very very different back then. \n\nI'm in my 40s now and rewatched the film recently. Val to me now is a self-centred character who hurts people's feelings without a second thought just to get to his own happy ending. In other words - he's 20. He is hurtful, yes, but not malicious. I don't think he's homophobic either. We have to bear in mind that in the 90s, having this kind of family setup was not accepted or common at all. \n\nI have lied about my own family in conservative professional settings myself in the past. These days I would never do that, but it's also 2024 and I'm over 40 and dgaf anymore. \n\nIn short - Val is selfish, but I also feel for him as someone who remembers what it's like to be 20 and want to be \"not-different\" sometimes.",

It\u2019s not like it was easy or pleasant to be a publicly out gay person in most places in the world; let alone easy. \n\nThis is essentially, though a comedic effort, a look into the idea of \u201cfamily values\u201d and what that means in the day and age of the mid 90s. Val is still a jerk in this lens, but given the context of the time, the scenario (while exaggerated and outlandish) wasn\u2019t far off from a common reality for a lot of people. \n\nHell, does anyone remember when Oprah tried to \u201cgot ya!\u201d Nathan Lane over his sexuality on national TV and Robin Williams came in and diverted attention away?

For example, Keaton gets treated like a buffoon at the beginning that that can\u2019t boil pasta, but at the same time we\u2019re supposed to believe he\u2019s a successful and intelligent workaholic that is very good at his job. The movie shows you that he\u2019s poor with his children, but then we get Mila whining about how good he is with his kids and how she never got that. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0So, which is it? The reason the contradictions exist is so that everyone can shit on Keaton in this movie. Even his wife shits on him, after he apologies to her for not knowing she was a drug addict, something that we can assume she hid from him. Keaton doesn\u2019t even get an apology from her. No apology for the divorce or hiding a drug addiction! In fact the movie goes out of its way to tell the audience that his wife never abandoned the family for 90 days without warning.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis movie was the story of how a man\u2019s life gets utterly destroyed financially, losing his gallery and soon a divorce while he has to raise two young children because his soon to be ex wife is an addict. The tone and the events of this move make no sense at all, they\u2019re at odds with each other. The tone should have been much more somber.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s almost like Keaton took this role as an apology for making too much money for his role in the flash.\u00a0",

Before the systems all got networked we would have to load DCPs onto individual cinema servers for individual projectors. Shows could be scheduled, but it was typically easier to start them manually than having to create dozens of schedules.\n\nNowadays all of the projectors are networked and run via a Theatre Management System. Content can be ingested automatically via the internet or via satellite (although physical hard drives do still get sent). Playlists and schedules for large cinema chains tend to be created by someone sat in an office. Said playlists are then pushed to multiple sites.\n\nThis means that mistakes can affect dozens of cinemas.

I love Sci fi but I only ask they follow the rules of their own story and have each side at least vaguely make sense.\n\nThe aliens know we are resourceful and despite inferior technology we defeated then previously.  And we now have their technology albeit the weapons aren't quite as destructive. They seem to be returning to achieve 3 goals (in no particular order):\n\n1 Revenge for their previous defeat \n2 Harvest earth's resources (again)\n3 Deatroy the other alien races robot ball thing\n\nThey really have no need for us to be alive to achieve any of these goals. They start strong, wiping out our orbital defences. Then why land? Just bombard anything that could be a weapon from the safety of space. Bombard all cities from space. They have the ability to do this. If somehow the ball thing still survived They could then search safely at their leisure.\n\nNow, to be fair, the same problem could somewhat be said of the first film. Except it was easier to understand the aliens underestimating us. It was their first encounter and we were by far technologically inferior. And their strategy was actually more sound as they hit the large population areas straight away and had a solid defence against our best weaponry.\n\nFor me Resurgence just felt daft. Like someone literally just said 'people loved the big ships! Let's have a bigger one! Bigger equals more suspense!' Except to me it just felt like a gimmick.",

They should\u2019ve never did this without him. \n\n2. CGI over practical effects. Little known fact about the first one, it holds the record for most miniatures effects shots of any feature film. The buildings, the ships, the planes, the aliens, the explosions. That was almost all practical effects using models, pyrotechnics, and puppets. I think the only CGI that was done was for the compositing and lasers. It holds up remarkably well today because it\u2019s real. Compared to its sequel where almost everything is CGI and looked dated the day the film came out. The awe and wonder is gone. And for a disaster film spectacle is everything. \n\n3. David Arnold\u2019s score. If the practical effects were the key to the original\u2019s success visually, Arnold\u2019s score did the same emotionally. It was fun, it was thrilling, triumphant, and sentimental in all the right places. You can\u2019t hear that famous speech in your head without also thinking of the music that accompanied it. I still think of it in my top 20 favorite scores of all time. What do we got here? Generic, bland, filler music courtesy of Harold Klosser. Don\u2019t know him? He\u2019s been scoring Roland\u2019s films for almost 20 years with maybe 1 good one (Day After Tomorrow). Everything else is forgettable. For me, music matters a ton in a film.

I don't think most of us realized that it was a 4 hour movie because half the people in the theater ran out at intermission in order to use the restroom and hit the concession stand.\n\nI thought the film was visually stunning.  The locations, sets, cinematography, and action were all amazing.  On the flip side, I couldn't really stand Lawrence for most of the movie and I was sick of the music about half way through.

I was jealous of the others, wishing I could enjoy myself as much as they were.\n\nThere was one exception: one girl seemed to be bored just as much as I was. During those two hours, we bonded over our boredom. We exchanged frequent sighs of frustration and glances of \"*are we done yet*?\"\n\nI think that's when we first fell in love. We stayed together for seven years.\n\nAs it turns out, mutual boredom is not a solid foundation for a relationship. It's actually one of the worst reasons to be in a relationship.

I also recommend that doc because it draws connections from *Showgirls'* strong points (and from its weakpoints) to his earlier Dutch films and to his post-Hollywood work. Berkley in particular should not be blamed for a bad performance. Her role was similar to leading ladies from Verhoeven's earlier movies like *Keetje Tippel* or  *[The Happy Hookers of Amsterdam](https://letterboxd.com/film/business-is-business/).* He clearly directed her that way, and she understood the assignment.\n\nIn the context of Verhoeven's entire oeuvre, *Showgirls* may not be his best movie or even a good movie, but it makes a lot more sense. He got his start making Euro-sploitation like *Spetters* and *Turks Fruit*, and in the last 10 years made a rape-revenge film and a nun-sploitation film. Most people in 1993 knew him as the sci-fi action guy who made Sharon Stone into a sex symbol, and the studio leaned into those expectations when they marketed *Showgirls* as NC-17. And can you blame them? *Showgirls* bombed because NC-17 ratings prevent anyone from bringing teenagers into the movie, so bye bye box office, but it did very well on home video (can't imagine why).\n\nThe film was only reevaluated positively once critics in the 2000s realised *Starship Troopers* was a masterpiece of satire. It received a similarly tepid reaction from critics when released immediately after *Showgirls*, and I think that we wouldn't have seen *Showgirls* become a cult film had *Troopers* not become one first. The *Nomi* Documentarians argue that it was easier for people to take a bloody sci-fi satire seriously than it as to take the real  grotesquerie of the real entertainment industry seriously, because American society in the '90s was quite sexist. *Showgirls* found its cult among the LGBT community because the theme of found family and lesbian love resonates more with them in spite of how sexist the whole film feels.\n\n*Hollow Man* sucks comprehensively though. THAT is Verhoeven's worst movie, but still a fascinating watch.",

The franchise was defeated by its own success, and forcing the Balboa family to return to a modest living was a huge step forward. It also advances Rocky as a character.\n\nThis was the first REAL look at his post-fighter career. How would he deal with aging and being out of the spotlight? Taking Gunn under his wing and living vicariously through Gunn's success at the expense of his relationship with his son was really interesting. \n\nRemember how the first movie ended with him embracing Adrian? Rocky V is a movie about a man who has his fame taken away, ending with him coming full-circle and remembering that the love of his family is what gives him strength.\n\nFrom an execution perspective, it also sees the return of Avildsen as the director. No disrespect to Stallone, but his directing skills pale in comparison to the man he trusted to helm the original.",

Pretty camerawork, some compelling drama, a few good songs, and great performances can\u2019t course correct this. The film takes a sharp turn off a cliff around the third act after Emilia and Jessi fight. Everything felt too extreme from what we saw of those characters. Not to mention Rita\u2019s arc with wanting to bring justice to people is straight up forgotten about (why did they imply conflict between her and Emilia just to never do it). \n\nThe themes also feel very daft. I\u2019m not a trans person, but I will say this is very obviously a film by a European trying to portray Mexico. Even with the trans themes, it didn\u2019t elicit those same sensations that other trans stories like I Saw the TV Glow did for me. So much of it feels commodified(? idk if that\u2019s the right term) in a sense. The musical numbers at the beginning just felt very goofy. Everyone\u2019s already mentioned the penis to vagina song, but Rita lecturing the doctor about Emilia\u2019s desire feels very weird with how she was essentially forced into this situation.",

I would assume the face tattoos, grill and hair really helped her channel this man the way she did.",

        "comment_body": "If you're into character-driven films with a darker, introspective vibe like American Beauty, The Virgin Suicides, and Girl, Interrupted, I\u2019d recommend checking out Requiem for a Dream, which delves deep into addiction and despair with intense visuals. Donnie Darko has that surreal, mind-bending quality similar to The Truman Show, while The Hours weaves multiple emotional narratives about women struggling with mental health and societal pressure. The Bell Jar offers a haunting look at depression and identity, much like Girl, Interrupted, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind combines whimsy with a deeper exploration of memory and relationships. If you\u2019re in the mood for something with a dark twist, Thoroughbreds and Fight Club both have unexpected turns that explore existential themes and personal breakdowns. Melancholia offers a meditative, visually stunning exploration of depression and impending doom, while The Squid and the Whale offers a quieter, character-driven look at family and personal struggles. Lastly, A Ghost Story is a slow, haunting meditation on loss and time that carries that quiet emotional weight you might appreciate. Each of these films blends complex characters with deep emotional struggles and often a twist in the third act, much like the ones you already love.",

Seeing as the receptionist tells him to call his wife, logic would dictate that the wife called, the receptionist called his desk, no answer and no answering machine so his wife couldn\u2019t leave whatever private message she wanted to leave and she wasn\u2019t comfortable leaving it with the receptionist.\n\nSo the series of events is most likely, Mills goes to work early as usual, he\u2019s out of the office with Somerset, his wife calls to speak to him, maybe to reveal their baby, she hangs up, John Doe arrives at their door not long after. Later in the day Doe arrives at the police station at the same time as the detectives are returning themselves. \n\nAnother edit: He arrives in a taxi and he couldn\u2019t have just had luck in the fact that they returned just as he arrived so he was probably following them around all morning/afternoon in that taxi after visiting the cheapo FedEx place to mail the box.\n\nEdit: I deleted my first paragraph as I completely misread the end of your post.",

        "comment_id": "lx35f8l",
        "comment_body": "My reviews from letterboxd of the ones I've seen, if anyone's interested:\n\n**Furiosa:** Despite pushing eighty, George Miller hasn\u2019t lost a beat and he once again put Hollywood blockbusters to shame with his Mad Max madness. In true prequel fashion, Furiosa fleshes out the main character with a backstory we probably didn\u2019t really need to know, it shows the origin of things like her gun, and it ends exactly where Fury Road starts. None of this is a criticism against the film, though, as Furiosa does all of these things very well and Miller\u2019s post-apocalyptic world is fun to explore. The first half of the film is a bit bloated, though, and it doesn\u2019t really become the amazing action spectacle until Anya Taylor-Joy finally takes over from young Alyla Browne. The action set pieces that follow are tremendous, especially the first big run of the war rig and the combined motorcycle and aerial assault on it. Chris Hemsworth is fun as the villain Dementus, straddling a fine line between menacing and goofy while Taylor-Joy is pure badass and a perfect replacement for Charlize Theron.\n\n**Kinds of Kindness:** Kinds of Kindness is a triptych of fables, each one weirder and more fantastical but all exploring Lanthimos' typical themes. All share a cast and some vague connective tissue, but they function as standalone stories. The first is probably the best one, with an intriguing and still kind of believable premise. It functions as a psychological thriller and is the closest to a \"normal\" movie. The second is equally as intriguing but introduces a lot of the signature Lanthimos kookiness that's fun to watch but practically impossible to comprehend. The third explores a wacky cult and is quite reminiscent of The Leftovers, which is never a bad thing. Jesse Plemons gives fantastic performances in the first two stories while Emma Stone is the star of the third, but all of the acting is good throughout the movie. It's well shot and has an eccentric vocal and piano score which helps skew any scene towards craziness. One will struggle to get any meaning from the film but it's so entertaining that perhaps it doesn't matter.\n\n**The Last Year of Darkness:** The Last Year of Darkness is a pretty intimate portrait of a couple of people. For example, one casually mentions being molested when he was seven while another talks about her suicide attempt. It roughly paints a picture of a certain subculture and the people in it, providing a window into a world most would find remote. As such, however, it doesn't really tell any coherent story or inform about any particular topic, which results in a film that could go on for another two hours or stop at any given moment and basically remain the same. A lot of it centers around a night club and there's a sense that it might get gentrified out of existence by a subway line being built right next to it, though this aspect of the ever-changing China is very underdeveloped. The film looks great, dropping a couple of truly stunning shots and soaking the viewer in night club strobes, oppressive cityscapes and dynamic sequences of a guy riding a scooter. It's just not that captivating as a whole.\n\n**Longlegs:** Longlegs starts strong. The first half is full of tension, mystery, and a creepy atmosphere which pulls the viewer in. The quick glimpses we get of the titular villain are unsettling and one gets the tingling sense that this might turn out to be a genre classic. But as the plot progresses and revelations pile up, this sense fizzles out. When all his cards are on the table, it turns out that Oz Perkins was bluffing. Longlegs isn\u2019t some clever stroke of genius. The plot is actually kind of nonsensical and many of its elements fall flat or feel underdeveloped. The film is ambiguous about whether or not it actually contains supernatural elements, which is just one of several things left wide open (but not in a smart sort of way where one can analyze it and discover new things). The more one sees of Longlegs, the less impactful he is as well. There are good performances all the way through and the film is very well put together on the technical side of things. But as for the script, Perkins should have done at least one more rewrite.\n\n**The Substance:** Frank Henenlotter and Brian Yuzna have a worthy successor to carry the torch of 80s body horror. The Substance is cut from the same cloth as Basket Case or Society, with a little Cronenberg thrown in for good measure. And by cloth I mean latex, because this film has amazing prosthetic makeup the likes of which we haven't seen in years. But apart from being a wonderful throwback, does The Substance have any uhm, substance? It establishes clear rules, allowing the viewer to understand the mechanics and stakes involved. The story's message is also crystal clear with no subtlety in sight, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, though even a hint of a hidden meaning would have been nice. Maybe it's dumb to complain about a lack of restraint in a movie like this, but the final act is extremely excessive and drawn out. The two mostly naked leads Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley are excellent while Dennis Quaid is an amusingly gross TV exec (named Harvey, wink wink). The film is also tremendously visually appealing and inventive.",

        "comment_body": "They make relatively cheap, straightforward movies from a production standpoint (not a criticism). Most of their movies shoot in a couple of months with budgets of 10-30 million dollars. Roger Deakins has said that every scene is meticulously storyboarded before filming starts - on *No Country For Old Men*, he said there's maybe a dozen shots that they filmed and cut from the movie, and they shot maybe a quarter as much film as an equivalent production of that size - that means less time filming (because they're not filming things that aren't in the movie) and less time in post-production (because they know what they've shot and how they want to cut it together). They're also often working with people they've worked with before - Roger Deakins has made a dozen movies with them, Carter Burwell scored almost all of their films, many members of their casts have appeared across multiple of their movies.\n\nAll up, it makes an efficient movie-making machine that knows exactly what it wants to make, makes it, and can roll on. Combine that with financial and critical success making it relatively straightforward for them to get their next movie made, and it's far from impossible to make a movie every year or two.",

In my opinion, it's because those who lived in whatever decade as kids/young adults have grown to be the people in power for media and fashion, and they want to bring back what they know.\n\nIn the late 90s, there was a time where all the girls in my class were wearing bell-bottoms and those hippie style shirts. And of course That 70s Show. Then in high school and college in the 00s, I started seeing more 80s parties and all the fashion that came with it.\n\nIt will only continue, and every new group of high school students will have their nostalgia moment ~10-~20 years after graduation.

        "comment_body": "There\u2019s a really interesting dynamic where Song used a grounded story to explore her emotions regarding the \u201ctriangle\u201d. To her, it was only ever really about aspects of her own being, as opposed to any actual threat to her marriage.\n\nKuritzkes turned to melodrama and uses Art as this avatar for someone who feels unworthy of his relationship and like he\u2019s a disappointment to his partner. The triangle serves as a point of contrast that allows us to measure Art\u2019s sense of inferiority until, at the end, it\u2019s banished completely and he finally earns Tashi\u2019s respect. Not to mention his own self-respect.\n\nChallengers is way less \u201cinspired by true events\u201d than Past Lives, way more hyperbole and exaggeration, but the character arc matches Arthur\u2019s in Past Lives pretty well. \n\nReally cool to see how each approached it.\n\nKuritzkes has made a bit of a show, in this interview too, about Challengers not being inspired by the events that inspired Past Lives. I read a a lot of them and sometimes he was more defensive, other times more neutral. But there was one where he finally admitted it was a really personal thing and he didn\u2019t want to talk about it. \n\nMust be complicated to have gone through that, come to terms with it, then not only face it again in the form of cinema but have it immortalized like that. To be clear, I\u2019m not critiquing or judging him. Just empathizing. \n\nLiterary analysis of [Past Lives](https://filmcolossus.com/past-lives-2023-explained).

A triangle is full of tension. Any time that one point in a triangle moves, or the distance between two points in a triangle moves, the distance between the other point moves as well. All the angles have to readjust as well.\u201d\n\n\n\n>\u201cYou find love triangles again and again in movies because it\u2019s just this naturally tense shape that has to keep reforming itself,\u201d Kuritzkes said. \u201cOnce you start to look for love triangles in movies, you go beyond the obvious ones like \u2018The Dreamers,\u2019 \u2018Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n,\u2019 or \u2018Band of Outsiders.\u2019 Even Hitchcock directed love triangle movies like \u2018Notorious.\u2019 \u2018Casablanca\u2019 has a love triangle in it. \u2018Titanic\u2019 has a love triangle in it. There\u2019s something about these three points in space and no relationship being defined purely in two directions that makes it a constantly shifting and evolving thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n>He added, \u201cIf you think about movies being about perspective, who\u2019s looking at who and what the camera is choosing to look at and where the eye is being directed\u2026 If you think about a love triangle movie, any time you\u2019re watching a scene between two characters in the love triangle, you\u2019re always kind of watching it from the perspective of the third character. That to me feels just inherently cinematic. That\u2019s why I was drawn to it for \u2018Challengers.\u2019 You\u2019d have to ask Celine about her movies.\u201d",

Star Wars: A New Hope is the first blockbuster movie and if you weren\u2019t around to see it back then you just cannot comprehend how incredible it was and fortunately it still holds up. And Spielberg has created some of the most iconic films, moments and tropes in history and both of their films set the standard for the future of Hollywood. \n\nStart with Spielberg- \n\nJaws.\n\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind. \n\nIndiana Jones (first three- raiders of the lost ark, temple of doom, and the last crusade)\n\nET\n\nJurassic Park\n\n\n\nLucas - \n\nOriginal Star Wars trilogy \n\n\nScott - \n\nAlien (R rating) \n\nGladiator\n\nThe Martian  \n\n\nCameron -\n\nAliens (sequel to Ridley Scott\u2019s Alien and rated R)\n\nTitanic - highest grossing film of all time until 2009\n\nTerminator 2: Judgement Day (also rated R)\n\nAvatar.- highest grossing film of all time since 2009 and I believe ever\n\n\nI know I threw a few R rated films in there but they\u2019re essential Hollywood films and given that they\u2019re a little older they\u2019re not that upsetting- granted you might disagree and are free to not watch them. If you do end up watching an R rated movie, Terminator 2 is probably the least \u201cscary\u201d of the three and is one of the best action movies of all time.\n\nFrom there go through the IMDB top 100 films. Shawshank redemption, The Godfather, The Dark Knight, Lord of the Rings trilogy etc.\n\nI\u2019d also watch Robert Zemeckis movies - Back To The Future, Forrest Gump and Cast Away.\n\nEDIT: I did forget to mention Christopher Nolan. He\u2019s the biggest director, IMO, that has come out in the last 20 years. Check out The Prestige, his Batman trilogy, Inception and Interstellar. Watch interstellar and compare it to say Star Wars to see his Hollywood has changed in the last four decades",

It also features Bruno Ganz reprising his role as an angel from Der Himmel \u00fcber Berlin (Wings of Desire), another favorite of mine.\n\nBut there are also many more great films that have come from Iceland in the last few years and decades. I kinda guess and hope Angels of Universe, from 2000, will win the vote here, and it's a wonderful movie with GREAT soundtrack by Sigur R\u00f3s and Hilmar \u00d6rn. However, we've also had a lot of really nice new movies in more recent years. Godland, from 2022, Snerting from 2024, Lamb from 2021, Heartstone from 2016 and well, actually, many more.\n\nWhile Iceland is tiny, we have a sizeable movie industry since a lot of Hollywood movies have been filmed here in recent years, giving a big boost to local production as well. Few examples would be Interstellar, Prometheus, Batman Begins, two Star Wars movies, two James Bond movies, Game of Thrones, and the list goes on and on.",

When you really break down the movie the actual argument  the guy with glasses comes up with is very strong and the kid very well could\u2019ve killed his father. But none of them outside of Fonda\u2019s character looked past his class or race to come to a true definitive decision based on the evdence. 12 Angry Men is easily in my top 5 movies ever.

Halloween and Friday the Thirteenth were way worse about repeating the same thing. Obviously Friday the Thirteeth takes the cake for worst sequels since we got Jason X, where he is IN SPACE, and it's still the exact same movie.\n\nNightmare on Elm street was also the best at keeping the bad guy's powers consistent. In Halloween and Friday they both started as just normal (well, super jacked but otherwise normal) people doing killings but they both got more and more supernatural and the sequels went on.",

Also, if you feel interested, it's worth it checking the background of this movie and how the dictatorship in Brazil deeply affected our society. \n\nThis is a movie for us, Brazilians, not to forget our past and to everyone outside of Brazil to understand a little bit more of our history.\n\nI really hope Fernanda Torres get a nomination to Oscar and that the movie gets nominated for best foreign movie, but even if it doesn't, it's already such a beautiful project that amidst the adversities of working with movies in Brazil, managed to be materialized. \n\nPs: the director managed to replicate everything so well, from the scenarios that transport you to Rio in the 70s to the pictures of the family.",

And also, lessor but an important theme, that the wife\u2019s indigenous heritage gives focus to the issue of missing and murdered indigenous females. I thought it was important that Sean seemed much more emotionally damaged from this loss compared to his wife, as acceptance by her as a woman in her culture of the way this issue has been ignored. There also seemed to be a connection late in the movie to the villains devaluing the life of the murdered woman spreading to them trying to kill the main character. So the main shootout became a clash of values on this value. I haven\u2019t watched the movie in some time so I may be off on these views, but the first point above maybe comes from being a father myself.",

Not to mention writing, directing, even music. His method of using emotional reactions that were less theatrically dramatic (think Shakespeare) and more subtle and poignant to engage the viewer sort of set the stage (no pun intended) for future filmmakers and actors of the next several generations.  (And frankly, asking some rando on the street if they'd seen a Chaplin film is a really poor test of the impact he had on the industry, and maybe only a test of what's currently popular).",

The most memorable thing was when protesters rushed the screening and started screaming over the introduction while Ben and David were standing on stage. It went on for like 5-10 minutes. Very awkward.\n\nOtherwise, it was okay. Very much a movie you've seen before, especially the first act full of cliches (Stiller as the stereotypical middle-aged, work-obsessed doofus, steps on poop, etc) but eventually finds its footing thanks to the great work by the 4 child actors (who are all real-life siblings).",

Having money at all was the coolest thing ever to us at that age, and we haven't fully developed that empathy to recognize that winning in a zero-sum game means hurting the other party. That's why we don't really see the early victims. It's a game for him at this point.\n\nForm memory, the more serious crimes that can have real consequences - such as playing doctor where he's consulted for treatments, and seducing Brenda - happen later in his career, where the audience can see he's crossing a line from petty crime and ripping off corporations, and entering a realm where he will start hurting people for his cons. And then he gets caught. We also see the decay in his appearance as well as his loneliness being the price of his cons, showing that it does take a toll.\n\nSo the movie is taking a moral position, but it allows itself to 'discover' that morality as Frank does.",

It purported to be autobiographical, and it was written with a charming, young, self-impressed tone that carries through to the movie.\n\nAs early as 1978, two years before it was published (but while Abiganale was speaking publicly about his supposed exploits), fact checks started questioning the veracity of... all of it. At the time, Abiganale defended the claims.\n\nLater, he would say he barely had anything to do with the book and of course it was exaggerated.\n\nThe meta twist, which was unintentional in the book but intentional in the movie, is that you're supposed to question someone who tells amazing and unbelievable tales of telling amazing and unbelievable lies. \n\nSo as much as a bad guy as he would have been had he done those things, is he better or worse for merely having lied about having done those things? Are we supposed to root for him as a Ferris Bueller character, or against him as a psychopathic fraud? And if the latter, for the fictional frauds he invented or the real fraud he perpetrated with the book? \n\nI think Spielberg brought a light touch (perhaps too light) to a pretty nuanced story. Especially given that the book was already old at the time, perhaps he should have hinted more that the whole thing might be a fantasy, told for profit, and that the irony of the \"catch me\" title is about the protagonist's lies *to the audience*.",

I would classify it as more of a suspense/thriller than a true horror movie, with a lot of tension throughout but not many \"scares\". The acting in this movie is far and away the best part, with Hugh Grant having an absolute blast on screen and the two female leads (Thatcher and East) being able to hold their own against that incredible performance. There is some criticism that the final act falls flat; while I don't necessarily disagree, I think it's more that it simply can't match how well executed the first half is rather than it simply being lackluster. That being said, a subpar ending sticks in your mind longer than a subpar beginning and reception to the film reflects that.\n\n\nBeing titled **Heretic**, clearly religion plays a central role. I would say it is fairly respectful of religion, despite the plot being >!Grant's character challenging the faith of the missionaries and at times coming off as an edgy teenage atheist!<. I think both religious and non-religious moviegoers could find things to appreciate about the movie. \n\n\nI would recommend if you're in the mood for a smart-ish suspense film, but I don't think this is a movie I will find myself re-watching anytime soon. 7/10",

It itself technically isn't really cyberpunk IMO since it lacks \"cyber\" elements, but it heavily influenced the aesthetic of cyberpunk stories and futuristic dystopian films for years to come. And it's sequel 2049 is just really really good. Both are very slow burn though.\n\nThe Mad Max movies. The \"must see\" movies are Road Warrior and then Fury Road (and optionally Furiosa, though it's a very different movie). The original Mad Max was basically a super low budget revenge film set right at the start of the collapse of society, and Beyond the Thunderdome is kinda silly, but if you enjoy the others, you might check them out.",

Like\n\n>Or the classic \u201clisten to your heart, not your mind\u201d message\n\nThat wasn't the message I took from when they were talking about those things. It wasn't about listening to your heart, it was about love prevailing beyond.\n\n>The robot has half its parts removed by raccoons and somehow keeps functioning perfectly.\n\nThat's called a joke.\n\n>Then it throws away its heart, main part, near the end and still works fine\n\nVery clearly not her heart, it's her battery. Which is explained in the movie she doesn't need to work but is limited without it. It's a sacrifice for her kid.\n\n>They fight off the first ship, but then, for some unexplained reason, call another one.\n\nThey literally explained that in the scene. She says that they will keep coming, the animals say they will keep fighting and she says no because she wants to protect them and the island. When the first ship came they made it clear that they had found her even though she wasn't signaling so she's right that they would have kept coming for her.\n\nI don't get how you can have such strong feelings while also missing such obvious points about the movie",

        "comment_body": "Like a lot of seminal films, Blade Runner seems somewhat unimpressive to younger moviegoers because you grew up marinating in the films it inspired. Before Star Wars, science fiction movies were few and far betwween, and generally seen as kid's stuff. They were a niche product. There's an exception or two, like perhaps Planet of the Apes and 2001: A Space Oddyssey, but even these movies had very rudimentary special effect, limiting their impact and broad appeal.\n\nIn 1977, George Lucas created, I would argue, the most influential film in the history of cinema, not by making a great and moving story, but by delivering truly excellent visual effects. That isn't to say Star Wars' story was bad, it just wasn't particularly great. But it was still unapologetically a kid's movie. They sold dolls and lunchboxes based on the IP.\n\nBlade Runner, on the other hand, was the first successful attempt to make a film with the production values of Star Wars and a more sophisticated story, specifically a *noire* story, about fugitives, corrupt police, amoral captains of industry, and a femme fatale. And at the time, that was something nobody had seen before. As you say, the film trades heavily on its thematic morality play about the immorality of slavery and the fragility of life. But I wouldn't say that the simplicity of the story detracts from the film, in point of fact, it's because the story is so rudimentary that the film is able to revel in the atmospheric and thematic components that Ridley Scott is trying to show. I couldn't disagree more that \"tell\" is better than \"show\". I don't want to be to be lectured, I want to be entertained.",

When her phone rang they stole it and were playing keep away despite the fact that she needed to be on call.\n\nI also remember Nate being kind of dismissive about Andy's job, and wasn't really very supportive of her. He would complain about her not being available, and get mad at her for it, instead of being understanding and accommodating.\n\nAgain, I could be remembering scenes wrong, but I do remember watching it for the first time and thinking how inconsiderate and annoying Nate and her friends were.",

Only gore is at the part everyone knows about.\n\nDarkness Falls. Early aughts goofy creature feature. I love for some reason. \n\nCandyman (either, both are amazing). Old spirits whose existence depends on the rumor communities keep alive. \n\nThe Thing. A spectacular movie. But it's got a good amount of body horror and gore.\n\nThe Gate. Parents are gone for the weekend and the kids find out the hole in their backyard leads to demons. A great entry level horror movie. Only thing to worry about is some light body horror and outdated language.\n\nThe Mouth of Madness. (Yes I'm a john carpenter suckup). Inspired by lovecraft. An insurance investigator has to track down an author who some believe is driving people insane with his books. \n\nSession 9. Very slowburn and psychological. Not everyone's cup of tea but a movie I'll always suggest. \n\nPumpkinhead. More creature feature goodness. A father makes a deal with a demon to avenge his son killed in an accident. Light gore.\n\nThe Graveyard Shift. Some Stephen King adaptation. Creature feature featuring some great hammed up acting. \n\nChild's Play (OG). It might have a long history but the first movie isn't actually all that gory. A classic killer doll movie. \n\nPoltergeist (OG). Another classic. Family moves into neighborhood that's haunted. \n\nUs. Great and weird horror movie. A family is hunted by a strange group of people that appear to be their doubles.",

It's amazing how certain films can take on completely different meanings as our lives change.\n\nThat first viewing with him became part of your story together, and now the movie serves as this beautiful but bittersweet mirror to your own experience - two people whose timing and paths didn't quite align, despite the genuine connection. The parallel to Mia and Sebastian's story is striking - how sometimes love isn't enough when you're both chasing different dreams in different directions.\n\nThe way you describe wanting to believe you might cross paths again someday really captures that tension in the movie - between holding onto hope and accepting that some relationships, no matter how meaningful, might just be chapters rather than the whole story. Sometimes the hardest part isn't losing someone, but accepting that they played their perfect role in your life exactly when they were meant to.\n\nI hope you can eventually find peace with however your story unfolds, whether it leads back to him or toward something entirely new. And maybe that's part of why La La Land resonates so deeply with so many of us - it validates both the heartache of these endings and the beauty of having experienced the connection at all.\n\nSending you a virtual hug.

Even at the end of his long miserable life he continues to hold on. He only stops fighting and accepts the death he imagined he was experiencing throughout his life when given explicit permission by the only authority figure left in his life.\n\nAnything positive I could divulge from the movie itself is equally tragic.

I dont \"like\" the way it makes me feel, but I adore that the movie is SO strong that it elicits the feelings it does...I dont know much cinema that's made me feel the way that movie did. My positive takeaway is that it's an incredible, fully realized work from an amazing writer. As Roger Ebert said of it:   \n  \n*\"This is a film with the richness of great fiction. Like Suttree, the* [*Cormac McCarthy*](https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/cormac-mccarthy) *novel I'm always mentioning, it's not that you have to return to understand it. It's that you have to return to realize how fine it really is. The surface may daunt you. The depths enfold you. The whole reveals itself, and then you may return to it like a talisman.\"*\n\nIn all fairness, I've seen it twice: Once when it came out, because I love Charlie Kaufman, and it left me shaken and sad yet hopeful, and impressed by great art. And once 10 years later, just after my dad died...I had been in a fog about his death and our complicated, strained relationship, and  this movie, like a skilled therapist, sliced me open. Everything poured out, my appreciation and anger and full realization of what the guy had really meant to me and how much I'd miss him. It was cathartic.\n\nI agree, it's one of the saddest movies Ive ever seen, but that doesnt mean it cannot also be one of the best movies I've ever seen. I love the cast, I love the production design, Iove the surreal situations and wordplay (i.e. his wife's name, Adele Lack Cotard, who paints tiny paintings, is a homophone for \"A delicate art\"). Ot's a bizarre fantasy that illustrates life in metaphorical terms. It makes me love the art of writing and filmmaking. That's my positive takeaway.",

So no camera or person saw him push a girl down the stairs? No camera showed him put on an apron and create a bomb in the kitchen. And why did the mom allow him to take her daughter to a concert with him and then let FBI know about it. It was bound to go down badly with her daughter being next to him. The daughter's survival was pure luck considering how many guns where there. How can he escape the limo with 30 people filming the car? Why are they shooting into the limo yet next time carefully use stun guns on him despite him actively killing an agent in that scene?\n\nMost of this is nonsense. It feels like it's made with no script. Not sure what happened. But it is indeed fun. It's hard to rate such movies. They engage yet are stupid as heck.",

We had to keep it for 3 months. This really pushed us to see a variety of movies we would normally wait to see on streaming. The results were fairly disappointing.\n\nWe saw 10 movies total and we plan to see 1 more before it expires. Of those there were 5 we felt were worth the time to schedule and go out for, and 5 we wished we had passed on. Of those 5 we enjoyed we decided 3 were made better by viewing it in a theater vs streaming.\n\n$25 per quality experience is not ideal for something that is not interactive. Sure there are some movies which should be seen in a theater, but the majority really aren't worth it. We wish we had just paid the $26 for the one movie and then waited for the streaming release for the rest.\n\nI think the increased importance of a movie in the theater is counteracted by the increased expectation of the time and financial commitment of the theater. It does add to the experience, but I think for most people the value proposition just isn't there.",

Though, one of the writers explained something very fitting that made the film rise above general 'popcorn-spectacle' (and probably made it Oscar winning); that for him, the film clicked into place when he started writing it not as a revenge movie where Maximus wants to kill Commodus, but as a man wanting to return to his family in the afterlife. Then they started sprinkling dialogue moments and scenes in the film to suit this narrative, and ending up making it a much more compelling film.\n\nLooking at these reviews, it seems what this writer described did not happen for this sequel and the film ended up probably just as a very watchable and epic popcorn movie with amazing battle sequences.",

The Atomic Age (1950s) brought on horror influenced by fears of nuclear radiation and sci-fi, like The Blob and Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\n\nThe Slasher Era of the 70s-80s is probably one you know with movies like Halloween and Friday the 13th. Then there\u2019s the Postmodern Horror of the 90s where Scream fits in, and it\u2019s all about self-aware horror. Now, we\u2019re kind of in the Modern Elevated Horror era with films like Get Out and Hereditary that mix horror with social commentary.\n\nEach era really reflects the fears and vibes of the time, so you\u2019ve got plenty of cool stuff to analyze.",

I don't necessarily imagine the heroine as a stand-in for me, in a good romcom I can kind of empathize with both characters so at the end I'm happy to see the girl get the guy but also happy to see the guy get the girl. They just both have to be reasonably attractive enough that you don't think \"Yikes I'm not sure it's a happy ending for him/her to wind up with somebody who looks like THAT.\" (Then again who knows, if the characters were REALLY likeable and the story was compelling enough a Marty Feldman/Anne Ramsey romance might have been a classic, lol).  I'm not a huge romcom person and I find Adam Sandler very annoying in a lot of his other roles, but I thought \"50 First Dates\" was a cute and enjoyable movie and it definitely didn't occur to me to be bothered by the fact that I don't personally find him sexy.",

Some people have been waiting years for this moment only to have it be taken from them because they weren\u2019t scrolling through r/IMAX at 11 at night. This article gets a few things wrong however:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n2: This article is incorrect when it comes to Fandango. It says people were able to buy tickets on the AMC website hours before they came on when in reality, it only about half an hour. In fact, you could actually buy tickets on Fandango prior to some theaters putting them on sale. I got my Dallas tickets hours before Cinemark put them on their website. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n3: The article states we have to wait to see if more theaters decide to carry the film, but we know there are more theaters set to show the film in the Digital IMAX format spread \u201cacross 40 cities.\u201d Not all, but some theaters have announced they are carrying the film.

The few more or less important women get little to no lines, Kriemhild has by far the most, Brunhild gets to talk some icelandic (IIRC) while being unnecessarily topless and later in the movie screams like 3 times. I guess there were some okay fighting scenes, not sure.\n\nBasically, just what you'd expect from a German movie production. Uninspired trash.",

It's about a pastor that can't cope with the evils of the world any longer and hence struggles with his job and his personal live. It's basically the theodizee hammered into a film.",

All he knows is Oswaldo is screaming and Joe Gage is pleading for his life. Technically, Mannix is still in charge when we cut away.\n\nAnyway, that's my best effort. But it does feel like a plot hole. I mean, why shot Warren if you're not prepared to spring out of the hole and capitalize on your element of surprise? Why doesn't Joe Gage go for the pistol Oswaldo drops? Where is that pistol when we cut back? Was there only two bullets in it? \n\nI can see two possibilities. 1 Tarantino knew that cutting to the flashback would cover up the jump to putting Mannix and Warren over by the bed, so he didn't need to worry about it, or 2 he had a whole extra 10 or 20 pages detailing exactly how we got from Warren screaming to Mannix dragging the chair, but cut it from the script.

I always wonder if there are still humans alive.  Surely the doctor didn't actually manage to be the last to live.... right?  That wouldn't make any sense.  The film frames it as if that's the case because 9 is awakened right when the doctor dies.  The doctor's body isn't decomposed, so he had to have only just died, meaning no substantial time skip.\n\nAlso, I like to group this together with **Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow** because they're both pretty much indie projects with small-ish budgets but look like they were made from 100+ million dollar budgets and are both pretty much the only feature length movies those directors made to this date.",
