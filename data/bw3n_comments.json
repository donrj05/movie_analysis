Gi-hun once again dives into the mysterious survival game, starting another life-or-death game with new participants gathered to win the prize of 456 billion won.  \n**Best Reason to Watch:**\u00a0Given the success of the original season,\u00a0[\u201cSquid Game\u201d Season 2](https://www.indiewire.com/news/trailers/squid-game-2-trailer-carousel-1235070133/)\u00a0is likely to attract quite an audience. So whether you were hooked by the initial episodes or found them a curious tedium, checking out the new episodes will be necessary to engage with the culture at large (and casual conversations) for a few days, at least.\n\n# 2. \u2018Black Doves\u2019\n\n**Release Date:**\u00a0Thursday, December 5  \n**Creator:**\u00a0Joe Barton  \n**Cast:**\u00a0Keira Knightley, Ben Whishaw, Sarah Lancashire, Andrew Buchan, Kathryn Hunter, Ella Lily Hyland, Gabrielle Creevy, Omari Douglas, Andrew Koji, Luther Ford, Adeel Akhtar, Paapa Essiedu  \n**Format:**\u00a06 hourlong episodes  \n**Official Synopsis:**\u00a0Set against the backdrop of London at Christmas,\u00a0[\u201cBlack Doves\u201d](https://www.indiewire.com/news/trailers/black-doves-trailer-keira-knightley-ben-whishaw-netflix-1235061133/)\u00a0is a sharp, action-filled and heartfelt story of friendship and sacrifice.

When her secret lover Jason (Andrew Koji) is assassinated, her spymaster, the enigmatic Reed (Sarah Lancashire), calls in Helen\u2019s old friend Sam (Ben Whishaw) to keep her safe. Together, Helen and Sam set off on a mission to investigate who killed Jason and why, leading them to uncover a vast, interconnected conspiracy linking the murky London underworld to a looming geopolitical crisis.  \n**Best Reason to Watch:**\u00a0Keira Knightley, duh! The actor behind \u201cAnna Karenina\u201d and \u201cLaggies\u201d and \u201cA Dangerous Method\u201d and \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d and \u201cSeeking a Friend for the End of the World\u201d is leading a TV show!

It\u2019s a played out concept no matter what but a better script would have laid some groundwork and paid it off better. Just having her randomly do kool and the gang and the choir join in and the pastor thank her profusely was lame. They could have at least showed her listening to that song when she was younger or something. Also that whole sequence could have been excised entirely and the plot would not have changed \n*  the whole \u201cdeal\u201d between Lindsay Lohan and Logan really didn\u2019t go anywhere. Another seemingly major plot point that could have been removed \n* the bit with the dog at the vet was funny and original. I liked that a lot. Chris Parnell looked weird as hell though, not sure what\u2019s going on there \n* the actor who played Logan was really good. Never seen him before but he had that X factor\n* funniest part was at the end when Lindsay is talking to Chenowith over the ring camera and says \u201cdoesn\u2019t this whole mean schtick ever get old\u201d \n* the big ending at the house party was a little much for me, hacky writing there. \n* I enjoyed the weirdo brother and all those interactions \n* Lindsay\u2019s boyfriend and his childhood friend\u2014 not good. That whole story could have used a few more rewrites. No chemistry at all between her and the boyfriend at any point in the movie",

If it's something you are watching intently, it's fine, but it manages to take it a step above any other ad-based service I've experienced in that it will pause the ad until you are back on the window and tab that netflix is on which can be annoying if you are, say, attempting to check your e-mail or social media messages while the ad plays. It is not able to distinguish having multiple windows visible at once, naturally. It doesn't care if you multitask while your show is playing, but the moment the ad plays, the ad needs to be your active window.\n\nIt's unironically kind of dystopic. It's the first time I've ever had a streaming service *force* me from multitasking to attempt to make me make the advertisement my main point of focus. It's tolerable if you treat it as an encouraged period to stretch your legs and adjust your eyes, hydrate and get something to drink, but still an unusually irritating feature. Unfortunately, the trick to get past the screen-blackening DRM (if you are watching on a browser, you can disable graphical hardware acceleration) does not work on the window-forcing advertisement DRM",

I don't know if it was editing, but Nate dismissed that lovely woman by saying she wanted things she never said she did. Instead of having a conversation about her thoughts on religion and church, he completely took her out by assuming she wanted to go to church everyday. Dude, you're the one who suggested praying. I'm disappointed that Logan isn't making them go on second dates as she recommends in her book. Maybe that's not interesting enough for a Netflix show? Or maybe they'll do that in later episodes?",

Any point between you and Netflix has issues, your bitrate goes to crap. So if one server suddenly lags there goes your quality. The 'apps' have been like that for a few months, I've had windows 10 for many years, and been using the various streaming service 'apps' since before they were so crap.   \n  \nNetflix was the first to do the stupid edge window thing but most of them are going away from windows store focus. Instead they're just going make a fancy edge window or similar 'containers' using that one chromium thing that so many other developers like using outside streaming instead, similar to what Element messenger uses. They don't really care about the windows store because of how much cheaper Android or iOS boxes are.\n\nBasically they're all focusing on android devices or ios devices for app development, if you want full quality they're expecting you to use streaming boxes or smart tvs. Sadly that's what a lot of companies are focusing on because it's cheaper to get a android streaming box including the firecube, or you can use apple TV. So they're going to throw the windows users to the wolves. If you want to be able to fully use the devices you're talking about they want you on android or IOS.",

You'll want to keep watching.\n\nTed Danson's character is totally likable, nearly lovable, and Ted Danson is fantastic--as are all the actors playing the characters at the nursing home where Ted Danson goes undercover. Some of the writing is a tad bit insulting to older people--sometimes making them into daft muddle-heads. But mostly it's quite good--at times quite humorous--more than just a smirk. And you come to care about the characters. They're nuanced, like actual people.\n\nSlight negatives:\n\nLilah Richcreek Estrada as the private investigator is perpetually sour, irritated, and unpleasant...it's out of proportion I don't get it. I've never seen her in anything else so maybe she chose to play her character this way.\n\nUnbelievable marriage between Ted Danson's daughter and her stay-at-home hapless Filipino husband and their 3 biological clearly teenage boys---who appear to be 100% Asian, rather than mixed (and are in reality Chinese/Taiwanese, Korean, and Filipino)---just lazy casting.\n\nBonus: San Francisco location--tho most scenes are just brief flashes of Nob Hill--and some cultural references.\n\n**Trigger warning: if you're sensitive about Alzheimers, there are a couple of minor side threads involving that; if you're not 'sensitive' to it.....it's still really poignant tho also very sweetly heartbreaking without being cloying or syrupy.**",

I\u2019ve seen \u201colder\u201d but that\u2019s about it, every other official site\u2019s summary just says \u201ccab driver.\u201d So you shouldn\u2019t have let that set a bad vibe for you so early into the movie. \n\nAnyway, all those red flags were acknowledged throughout the beginning of their conversation. Initially, it was a quiet ride. But Penn\u2019s character ultimately came to the conclusion that Johnson\u2019s character could \u201chandle herself\u201d which opened up the whole movie to the dialogue they eventually had that went deeper than just the surface. She could handle herself so he knew that she knew that these may be red flags to another woman but she is a strong enough female character to disregard the rough demeanor and exterior to find something deeper. Not to exclude the fact that a huge plot point was that she wasn\u2019t on her phone, making her very aware of her surroundings unlike most other passengers, female or not, adding to her persona of seeming like she can handle herself. In reality, her character would be the type of person to distinguish a true red flag, from a yellow flag, that would require further investigation. Which is essentially what happened as she light-heartedly entertained the talkative taxi driver. This then sets the stage for the movie. \n\nI felt this movie did a good job of creating a situation in which two completely different people (age, gender, sex etc.) had a rare opportunity to be 100% real with a stranger out of sheer curiosity. He probably talks to multiple passengers per day but never really breaks the surface; she, talking and revealing even less. \n\nBut because they were interesting enough to each other, and were somewhat forced to spend time with one another, they were able to serendipitously have a real conversation with another human being. With their differences, this provided perspective that both had not heard before, but happily would entertain. \n\nUltimately, by the end, they both learned from each other and received a rare human connection in an age of screens and social media. \n\nIs it believable? Probably not. But it\u2019s a movie.",

The panning camera and the random zooms made it feel like a mockumentary akin to Modern Family / The Office...except it's not. All the camera movements took a bit for me to get used to.\n\nThe audio levels were a bit obnoxious and chaotic...especially sound effects. The effects were soooo loud, there is a lot of script overlap... and characters talking loud over the effects. Not sure if it was on purpose to magnify the chaotic life of all the characters, or if it was just poor editing...regardless, it really threw me out of the show a lot.....but seemed to improve towards the end.",

There's also a lot of other problems with various streaming services otherwise that I won't get into, but again if you're only wanting netflix for the fight just get the '1080/HD' version, I've had that version for years after they stopped password sharing and it works fine for me.",

I love Zoe Saldana and I think her performance was brilliant but the accents were HORRIBLE and didn't make sense with the setting being in Mexico. Zoe with a Dominican accent, Karla who played Emilia with a SPANISH AF accent, and Selena I fucking wanted to shoot myself every time she spoke Spanish. I kept wishing the plot would eventually eliminate Selena from the story, but we had to listen to that horrible Spanish until the end. They had to write in some weird half-baked backstory about Selena being American, Zoe that she immigrated from the DR at 5, and Emilia that she spent so much time in Europe that she now has a Spanish accent? I mean Manitas was a fucking NARCO and he spoke like THAT? On sight seriously. Also how English-speaking actors have to get special voice and accent coaching to adopt Australian, British, American accents, etc. And yet they couldn't do that here? Is it that the audience they were catering to are non-Spanish speaking audiences who wouldn't notice???\n\nTo be fair, I live in Mexico and I know my Mexican friends would cringe at this movie. So maybe it is for the gringos and Europeans (the director and much of the team is French so it makes sense). I recently visited Europe and this movie felt like how it felt to eat a Mexican restaurant in Portugal - lackluster, stereotypical tropes, not NEARLY as good as the real thing. These people failed at cosplaying Mexicans and life in Mexico.\n\nThe movie started well and then plateaued by the second half. Pretty shallow depiction of Narcopolitics. Her transness wasn't really explored with much depth, kind of just used as a cheap plot device for having a \"second life\" that we didn't really learn anything about.\n\nI liked the musical aspect of this movie though, it wasn't cringe or over the top. The songs seamlessly mixed into the scenes. Choreography was really great!\n\n5/10",

Netflix only increased by $1 since 2012. And are more competitive pricing wise to other streaming services per content wise with exception to Hulu (tho it's generally lower quality)\n\nAds. That's fair. Personally I'm fine paying $3 more for it but I understand not wanting to do so.\n\nIt's worth remembering that from around 2020 to 2022 Netflix was actually losing money. So it's not exactly they had a choice to not raise the pricing or introduce another Renevue stream.\n\nAltho then again they could really start saving money by not putting Ryan Reynolds in every title costing millions of dollars and go for cheaper but still great actors.",

Many people on instagram said that by doing this they ruined the series and took away the best character, but hopefully like you said they have something good for season 5\n\nI will say finding out that JJ's dad wasn't his real dad and that he was a Genrette and a Groff didn't really make sense to me, I did feel that they added that in there because that was something in my opinion that you wouldn't have speculated from watching previous seasons that JJ's dad wasn't his dad, but thats just my opinion. Groff infuriated me throughout the whole series he is actually a sick greedy manipulative individual and I was yelling at my tv screen, really sad that JJ never got his happy ending in life or a true family who actually cared about him, but he had his friends and they did anything and everything for JJ even when he made numerous preventable mistakes (enduro also made me mad lol)\n\noverall I loved it, lots of emotions felt this season and I hope these kids get rich in season 5 so they can stop putting they life on the line pirate hunting lol, enjoyed watching it with my boyfriend this weekend :)",

While it can be convenient for users who want quick access to content, it can feel intrusive, especially when you only want to preview or look through options. Unfortunately, as you've discovered, there is currently no way to disable this autoplay feature. Netflix\u2019s support has acknowledged the issue, but there\u2019s no indication yet that they plan to make it customizable.  \nThis feature is likely tied to their goal of enhancing user engagement by encouraging faster content consumption. However, many users have voiced a desire for more control over autoplay behavior. Ideally, there should be an option to disable this feature, similar to how some platforms allow you to turn off autoplay for trailers. It\u2019s possible that Netflix will consider adding this as a customizable setting in future updates based on feedback.\n\nFor now, you might consider submitting further feedback or keeping an eye on any updates to the Roku app, as user demand could eventually lead to a change in how Netflix handles autoplay.",

Lucy basically disappears from the timeline or seems to disappear. Parents are already really overprotective of her, so this probably destroys the joyless marriage.\n\nEvil Quinn is from timeline 1 originally, but things get really messy here - there's at least one Paradox for sure.\n\nHow did evil Quinn know about the time travel devices without Lucy traveling back in time (this indicates that changing the past affects the future/present, which is impossible for Lucy to exist in timeline 2 if that's a fact).\n\nIf past affects the future and Lucy saving Quinn from the bullies happened in the past, there would he no evil Quinn or murders in the past.\n\nIf evil Quinn was only a result of his bullying and \"friend-zoning\" by Summer, that means that they would be alive in timeline 1 and Lucy would not have existed in that timeline because Timeline 2 is where the murders from timeline 1 Quinn (evil quinn) took place.\n\nThis is way too messy and I'm getting confused now...\n\nIf evil Quinn was born in timeline 1, Lucy could not have existed in that timeline, because evil Quinn is the murderer who went back in time and created timeline 2, where Lucy exists, by killing her friends. \n\nTimeline 2 is where Lucy is born, and when she travels back in time, it creates a third timeline where she has altered the past and supposedly prevented an evil Quinn from happening.\n\nShe travels FORWARD in time of timeline 3 to learn that saving her sister did in fact prevent her birth in timeline 3, she travels backward in time to a new timeline 4 where she exists along side her similarly aged sister - assuming her parents adopt her at some point. Quinn apparently still not evil in this timeline, but her friends murdered by evil timeline 1 Quinn are still dead.\n\nI think i could draw this out, but i had to work through it in my head first.",

This just feels like a grab for money at this point given that they have such a huge viewer audience. There's little to no character development in four seasons, so dragging it out another season wouldn't be as exciting anymore. Idk, they dropped the ball this season in my opinion. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if netflix tries to go for a S5 since there are so many returning viewers from S1-3. After S4, I doubt there will be as many returning for a S5. I'd probably use it as background noise if anything.",

        "comment_id": "lvqg1q5",
        "comment_body": "The problem with what you're talking about is another issue similar to what I've seen with people starting a streaming service that's only available in one country then blaming that service when they can't cancel unless they do it before leaving the country. It's a 1d10t error, aka user is too lost in their own little world to do what should be a simple effort to check before leaving/joining a service and make sure it's joined/left while in the correct country. Also similar to the \"I'm spending 2/3rds of my time outside my 'home location' for Netflix, and travel to too many countries to have the 'travel' feature apply to all the areas for my usage.\" It's not on the streaming service to do what should be easily done by the user, it's not on them to offer anything beyond one country/location as a user's service area, it's not required they offer downloads even if the tier of streaming says that's a feature. If you're too dense to pay attention to what version you're signing up for or checking your bank account every month to see if you're paying for the right version, that's on you.  \n  \nThese are all 'optional' extras offered on what is not legally required to offer anything beyond streaming shows at a single region/country for a single set of users. Hell even the 'streaming shows' isn't a legal requirement as these are private businesses we chose to sign up for and agree to EULA/TOS that is subject to change that we're warned plenty of time ahead. Also seeing a bunch of folks on Netflix and a bunch of other streaming service not understand how a lot of other things work either. 99% of the time any licenses rotate every month, meaning any show or movie, on either platforms that do say or don't say 'this is leaving soon', will lose things. Even programs that were owned by that platform at one time. The licenses required to keep those on the platforms when there's other partial owners mean it's easier to just license it out to someone else who's willing to pay to cover part of those costs. Plus they can be just cheap a-holes who want to save paying the folks who made the programs and will just pull the shows and movies. So you have a limited time to watch every single thing you see on the platform.  \n  \nPlus there's limitations to every single one of them depending on what version you're using. Ad based netflix doesn't allow casting, depending on where you're located ad based netflix licenses don't allow certain programs to be played with ads, including netflix exclusives because of the other owners. Also things that had features one week might not have them the next, saw someone who was casting European football on Peacock but it stopped working, and they somehow thought it was required it be offered when licenses can restrict that on one particular set of programs as well. Same reason why Peacock had such crap offerings for Olympics and so many other sports, because it was one of the many 'some items that have ads' programs because they paid for part of the licenses, and those licenses only allowed Peacock to hold the replay rights for short periods of time, quite varied depending on the particular event.\n\nJust like any captions/subtitles you're seeing are not required by any laws, yet I've seen users on netflix who want to see both their language and a friend's language as a caption on a program they're watching so both can see stuff that isn't translated on the other caption/sub. In the US any 'caption' requirements for the ADA only apply to things that are or were ever shown on cable/satellite/OTA TV, streaming platforms don't have to do jack squat for captions or subtitles beyond translating the language being spoken, it's another 'bonus' to attract a larger customer base. So they don't have to offer more then a single language to the customer base beyond the original on things that are dubbed, don't have to have any subtitle/caption languages on that audio track beyond the single language being spoken or translated. Some of the other niche streaming platforms aren't allowed to offer anything except a limited number of languages and captions/subtitles even depending on where they're located, so you have to know what you're signing up for to some extent before you sign up.",
