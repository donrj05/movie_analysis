I\u2019ve seen \u201colder\u201d but that\u2019s about it, every other official site\u2019s summary just says \u201ccab driver.\u201d So you shouldn\u2019t have let that set a bad vibe for you so early into the movie. \n\nAnyway, all those red flags were acknowledged throughout the beginning of their conversation. Initially, it was a quiet ride. But Penn\u2019s character ultimately came to the conclusion that Johnson\u2019s character could \u201chandle herself\u201d which opened up the whole movie to the dialogue they eventually had that went deeper than just the surface. She could handle herself so he knew that she knew that these may be red flags to another woman but she is a strong enough female character to disregard the rough demeanor and exterior to find something deeper. Not to exclude the fact that a huge plot point was that she wasn\u2019t on her phone, making her very aware of her surroundings unlike most other passengers, female or not, adding to her persona of seeming like she can handle herself. In reality, her character would be the type of person to distinguish a true red flag, from a yellow flag, that would require further investigation. Which is essentially what happened as she light-heartedly entertained the talkative taxi driver. This then sets the stage for the movie. \n\nI felt this movie did a good job of creating a situation in which two completely different people (age, gender, sex etc.) had a rare opportunity to be 100% real with a stranger out of sheer curiosity. He probably talks to multiple passengers per day but never really breaks the surface; she, talking and revealing even less. \n\nBut because they were interesting enough to each other, and were somewhat forced to spend time with one another, they were able to serendipitously have a real conversation with another human being. With their differences, this provided perspective that both had not heard before, but happily would entertain. \n\nUltimately, by the end, they both learned from each other and received a rare human connection in an age of screens and social media. \n\nIs it believable? Probably not. But it\u2019s a movie.",

Which has been great since it kind of has me enjoying the Christmas spirit already, especially since everywhere in public has seemed to have gone full Christmas too. \n\nIf you enjoyed this, definitely watch The Merry Gentleman.

Also on VPN services they have one called Netflix server from Atlanta I believe that fills up their bandwidth too. Maybe if they concentrated on their own servers instead of giving people gears about if they're in the household or updating their app constantly to yet another crappy version they might have had more success lol.

The panning camera and the random zooms made it feel like a mockumentary akin to Modern Family / The Office...except it's not. All the camera movements took a bit for me to get used to.\n\nThe audio levels were a bit obnoxious and chaotic...especially sound effects. The effects were soooo loud, there is a lot of script overlap... and characters talking loud over the effects. Not sure if it was on purpose to magnify the chaotic life of all the characters, or if it was just poor editing...regardless, it really threw me out of the show a lot.....but seemed to improve towards the end.",

Plus that means the stuff itself has to be recorded in 4k, so even if you're able to see a difference it won't mean squat if the thing itself isn't compatible. Also you're talking about very different companies with different focuses. You can get SOME 4k stuff on portable devices, but that's easier to do downloaded versus streaming. Especially when you consider how many folks don't have the kind of internet required to be able to stream 4k well.",

There's so many factors into what makes a 'good' stream that you could have everything be compatible with 4k on Netflix and STILL not get what you're paying for because some point between you and the server you're using for netflix is slowed down, so your bitrate is shit.   \n  \nUnless you plan on watching Netflix in multiple locations at once there is little to no point to get the '4k' service on Netflix or any of the major platforms, most tend to offer more screens as well as higher streaming quality if they don't have one set for everyone no matter the plan. There's also a lot of other problems with various streaming services otherwise that I won't get into, but again if you're only wanting netflix for the fight just get the '1080/HD' version, I've had that version for years after they stopped password sharing and it works fine for me.",

I love Zoe Saldana and I think her performance was brilliant but the accents were HORRIBLE and didn't make sense with the setting being in Mexico. Zoe with a Dominican accent, Karla who played Emilia with a SPANISH AF accent, and Selena I fucking wanted to shoot myself every time she spoke Spanish. I kept wishing the plot would eventually eliminate Selena from the story, but we had to listen to that horrible Spanish until the end. They had to write in some weird half-baked backstory about Selena being American, Zoe that she immigrated from the DR at 5, and Emilia that she spent so much time in Europe that she now has a Spanish accent? I mean Manitas was a fucking NARCO and he spoke like THAT? On sight seriously. Also how English-speaking actors have to get special voice and accent coaching to adopt Australian, British, American accents, etc. And yet they couldn't do that here? Is it that the audience they were catering to are non-Spanish speaking audiences who wouldn't notice???\n\nTo be fair, I live in Mexico and I know my Mexican friends would cringe at this movie. So maybe it is for the gringos and Europeans (the director and much of the team is French so it makes sense). I recently visited Europe and this movie felt like how it felt to eat a Mexican restaurant in Portugal - lackluster, stereotypical tropes, not NEARLY as good as the real thing. These people failed at cosplaying Mexicans and life in Mexico.\n\nThe movie started well and then plateaued by the second half. Pretty shallow depiction of Narcopolitics. Her transness wasn't really explored with much depth, kind of just used as a cheap plot device for having a \"second life\" that we didn't really learn anything about.\n\nI liked the musical aspect of this movie though, it wasn't cringe or over the top. The songs seamlessly mixed into the scenes. Choreography was really great!\n\n5/10",

Netflix only increased by $1 since 2012. And are more competitive pricing wise to other streaming services per content wise with exception to Hulu (tho it's generally lower quality)\n\nAds. That's fair. Personally I'm fine paying $3 more for it but I understand not wanting to do so.\n\nIt's worth remembering that from around 2020 to 2022 Netflix was actually losing money. So it's not exactly they had a choice to not raise the pricing or introduce another Renevue stream.\n\nAltho then again they could really start saving money by not putting Ryan Reynolds in every title costing millions of dollars and go for cheaper but still great actors.",

Many people on instagram said that by doing this they ruined the series and took away the best character, but hopefully like you said they have something good for season 5\n\nI will say finding out that JJ's dad wasn't his real dad and that he was a Genrette and a Groff didn't really make sense to me, I did feel that they added that in there because that was something in my opinion that you wouldn't have speculated from watching previous seasons that JJ's dad wasn't his dad, but thats just my opinion. Groff infuriated me throughout the whole series he is actually a sick greedy manipulative individual and I was yelling at my tv screen, really sad that JJ never got his happy ending in life or a true family who actually cared about him, but he had his friends and they did anything and everything for JJ even when he made numerous preventable mistakes (enduro also made me mad lol)\n\noverall I loved it, lots of emotions felt this season and I hope these kids get rich in season 5 so they can stop putting they life on the line pirate hunting lol, enjoyed watching it with my boyfriend this weekend :)",

While it can be convenient for users who want quick access to content, it can feel intrusive, especially when you only want to preview or look through options. Unfortunately, as you've discovered, there is currently no way to disable this autoplay feature. Netflix\u2019s support has acknowledged the issue, but there\u2019s no indication yet that they plan to make it customizable.  \nThis feature is likely tied to their goal of enhancing user engagement by encouraging faster content consumption. However, many users have voiced a desire for more control over autoplay behavior. Ideally, there should be an option to disable this feature, similar to how some platforms allow you to turn off autoplay for trailers. It\u2019s possible that Netflix will consider adding this as a customizable setting in future updates based on feedback.\n\nFor now, you might consider submitting further feedback or keeping an eye on any updates to the Roku app, as user demand could eventually lead to a change in how Netflix handles autoplay.",

Lucy basically disappears from the timeline or seems to disappear. Parents are already really overprotective of her, so this probably destroys the joyless marriage.\n\nEvil Quinn is from timeline 1 originally, but things get really messy here - there's at least one Paradox for sure.\n\nHow did evil Quinn know about the time travel devices without Lucy traveling back in time (this indicates that changing the past affects the future/present, which is impossible for Lucy to exist in timeline 2 if that's a fact).\n\nIf past affects the future and Lucy saving Quinn from the bullies happened in the past, there would he no evil Quinn or murders in the past.\n\nIf evil Quinn was only a result of his bullying and \"friend-zoning\" by Summer, that means that they would be alive in timeline 1 and Lucy would not have existed in that timeline because Timeline 2 is where the murders from timeline 1 Quinn (evil quinn) took place.\n\nThis is way too messy and I'm getting confused now...\n\nIf evil Quinn was born in timeline 1, Lucy could not have existed in that timeline, because evil Quinn is the murderer who went back in time and created timeline 2, where Lucy exists, by killing her friends. \n\nTimeline 2 is where Lucy is born, and when she travels back in time, it creates a third timeline where she has altered the past and supposedly prevented an evil Quinn from happening.\n\nShe travels FORWARD in time of timeline 3 to learn that saving her sister did in fact prevent her birth in timeline 3, she travels backward in time to a new timeline 4 where she exists along side her similarly aged sister - assuming her parents adopt her at some point. Quinn apparently still not evil in this timeline, but her friends murdered by evil timeline 1 Quinn are still dead.\n\nI think i could draw this out, but i had to work through it in my head first.",

If you want to see how the video will look interface wise after filming, just look at Jimmy Carr's Special: Natural Born Killer",

This just feels like a grab for money at this point given that they have such a huge viewer audience. There's little to no character development in four seasons, so dragging it out another season wouldn't be as exciting anymore. Idk, they dropped the ball this season in my opinion. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if netflix tries to go for a S5 since there are so many returning viewers from S1-3. After S4, I doubt there will be as many returning for a S5. I'd probably use it as background noise if anything.",

Yes HDMI, because DVI and NOTHING else except HDMI is compatible with the version that netflix requires for full 4k.

I really enjoyed the last one (Night Country) though as much for its setting as anything.\n\nI haven't watched any of those others.\n\nOther than that I'd suggest Arrow and The Flash, which were both great to start with but went on too long, not only losing much of their charm but also losing coherency in the process.\n\nBlindspot was cool to start with and had an interesting idea behind it (if not entirely unique, as, like Prison Break, it was based on the main character's tattoos) but ended up becoming a parody of itself. \n\nThe Blacklist was top tier to begin with but again, dragged on far too long and ended poorly.\n\nI'd also add Scandal - when it was actually a show about a fixer who actually fixed stuff and not about secret agencies and conspiracies with a main character who became not just insufferable but hateful.",

        "comment_body": "The problem with what you're talking about is another issue similar to what I've seen with people starting a streaming service that's only available in one country then blaming that service when they can't cancel unless they do it before leaving the country. It's a 1d10t error, aka user is too lost in their own little world to do what should be a simple effort to check before leaving/joining a service and make sure it's joined/left while in the correct country. Also similar to the \"I'm spending 2/3rds of my time outside my 'home location' for Netflix, and travel to too many countries to have the 'travel' feature apply to all the areas for my usage.\" It's not on the streaming service to do what should be easily done by the user, it's not on them to offer anything beyond one country/location as a user's service area, it's not required they offer downloads even if the tier of streaming says that's a feature. If you're too dense to pay attention to what version you're signing up for or checking your bank account every month to see if you're paying for the right version, that's on you.  \n  \nThese are all 'optional' extras offered on what is not legally required to offer anything beyond streaming shows at a single region/country for a single set of users. Hell even the 'streaming shows' isn't a legal requirement as these are private businesses we chose to sign up for and agree to EULA/TOS that is subject to change that we're warned plenty of time ahead. Also seeing a bunch of folks on Netflix and a bunch of other streaming service not understand how a lot of other things work either. 99% of the time any licenses rotate every month, meaning any show or movie, on either platforms that do say or don't say 'this is leaving soon', will lose things. Even programs that were owned by that platform at one time. The licenses required to keep those on the platforms when there's other partial owners mean it's easier to just license it out to someone else who's willing to pay to cover part of those costs. Plus they can be just cheap a-holes who want to save paying the folks who made the programs and will just pull the shows and movies. So you have a limited time to watch every single thing you see on the platform.  \n  \nPlus there's limitations to every single one of them depending on what version you're using. Ad based netflix doesn't allow casting, depending on where you're located ad based netflix licenses don't allow certain programs to be played with ads, including netflix exclusives because of the other owners. Also things that had features one week might not have them the next, saw someone who was casting European football on Peacock but it stopped working, and they somehow thought it was required it be offered when licenses can restrict that on one particular set of programs as well. Same reason why Peacock had such crap offerings for Olympics and so many other sports, because it was one of the many 'some items that have ads' programs because they paid for part of the licenses, and those licenses only allowed Peacock to hold the replay rights for short periods of time, quite varied depending on the particular event.\n\nJust like any captions/subtitles you're seeing are not required by any laws, yet I've seen users on netflix who want to see both their language and a friend's language as a caption on a program they're watching so both can see stuff that isn't translated on the other caption/sub. In the US any 'caption' requirements for the ADA only apply to things that are or were ever shown on cable/satellite/OTA TV, streaming platforms don't have to do jack squat for captions or subtitles beyond translating the language being spoken, it's another 'bonus' to attract a larger customer base. So they don't have to offer more then a single language to the customer base beyond the original on things that are dubbed, don't have to have any subtitle/caption languages on that audio track beyond the single language being spoken or translated. Some of the other niche streaming platforms aren't allowed to offer anything except a limited number of languages and captions/subtitles even depending on where they're located, so you have to know what you're signing up for to some extent before you sign up.",

Everyone can want to be rich, but only a few are successful to be one.\n\nOne thing I noticed is she documented how the ex-husband's cheating affected her. Yet she categorizes kissing someone else in a cathedral and the relationship with another man while married to him as not a form of cheating since she did not consider leaving his husband.",

She swore a lot too which I thought was funny lol. Not saying she didn't do anything wrong, but she definitely was made a scape goat for that court case. And Martha as the original influencer, I think is definitely true. Her new association with Snoop Dogg is just so much fun. She's an extremely versatile person. And I think that that has greatly contributed to her longevity and her likability.\n\nFrom Kmart to Snoop Dogg, Martha has it all!",

And in the end of final episode, you can see that Varee is very sad because she lost her mom (Panida) and got beaten by her husband. Then there's a scene Varee holding baby which is Min and told the baby that she's her life now, so i assume because of her trauma in her relationship and sadness because of her lost. She decided to adopt a baby which is accidentally herself.\n\nSo in a clear timeline\n\n1992 - Min (5 years old) has been travel to this timeline and Panida changer her name to Varee. There's a possibility that now in this timeline, there will be two version of Min.\n\n2019 - Varee adopt baby which is herself (Min)\n\n2024 - Varee is now maybe around 36 years old bringing younger version of Min (5 years old) to Panida house.",

The Netflix app isn't a thing anymore on 11, and possibly 10, it's just a fancy Edge window. So that doesn't make much difference. Plus Netflix itself limits it on ALL browsers/desktop devices. Not only that it requires specific things on every single device, cable, and peripheral related to showing video or it won't work.",

EVERYTHING deemed as evidence to support Linda's claim was subject to corruption and manipulation. Carol demonstrated that perfectly with the alternative explanation of the x-ray. Which reminds me.....\n\nThat little implant supposedly put there by aliens.....where is it? Why not take it out and test it? Why not photograph and test the actual implant. Why not test THE ONLY physical evidence in this case. I'll tell you why.......because that implant is nothing more than a curled up resistor. Almost every electronic device in those days had them. Google it \"Resistor\". There's your alien implant right there. Liars get caught eventually. And when they do, they aren't happy about it. Which makes sense looking back at Linda and Budds reactions to criticism.",

When this popped up on Netflix I thought 'Wow I haven't seen an abduction story in YEARS.' But that's because it's probably easily explained ...\n\nNot one person in this documentary mentions Sleep Paralysis. This is evidently the reason why MANY people have thought there were ghosts or even demons in their house over many years ... and then eventually some thought there were aliens.\n\nSame experiences with creative minds that use cultural and religious narratives to explain their terrifying, paralyzed nightmares. Sleep Paralysis is well documented in science (if not fully understood) and reddit has MULTIPLE stories of people experiencing Sleep Paralysis. They're amazing stories. People often start out stressed and sleep deprived and then they wake up but their body isn't fully awake ... \"hypnopompic ('upon awakening') hallucinations\" [https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/hypnopompic-hallucinations](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/hypnopompic-hallucinations)\n\nPeople have them sometimes once or even multiple times throughout their life and it's terrifying.  \nYou wake up and can't move. Often you feel something pressing on your chest so you can't breathe.  \nYou can look around your room and sometimes hallucinate.  \nPeople describe ghosts at the end of their bed, demons, dead family members (one even a dead pet cat), skeletal beings, bright lights, ... sometimes the entities pull at their feet or drag them. They can hear footsteps, screaming, loud noises.  \n... and then they wake and all disappears.\n\nIt just seems many of these 'phenomena' over the years are actually easily explained.  \nBut docs like this one or ENTIRE SERIES of shows on LMN like Celebrity Ghost Stories or The Haunting Of often tell stories that sound EXACTLY like Sleep Paralysis.\n\nSome stories are unique and not easily explained but the alien abduction stories really seem like Sleep Paralysis + cultural narratives.\n\n\\- \"Sleep paralysis, sexual abuse, and space alien abduction\" [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15881271/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15881271/)  \n\\- \"TIL that alien abduction stories are probably based on sleep paralysis\" [https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1eymt1/til\\_that\\_alien\\_abduction\\_stories\\_are\\_probably/](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1eymt1/til_that_alien_abduction_stories_are_probably/)  \n\\- Reddit's SleepParalysis definition: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/f8d1kj/identifying\\_sp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/f8d1kj/identifying_sp/)",

I felt so bad for that man, she absolutely broke him and seeing how the kids were so used to the abuse was crazy. \n\nThat story about when he told his daughter she should say what she thinks her mother wants to hear, then the mother asks the kid if she wants daddy to stay or leave so the kid says leave, but then she tried to wink at her dad so he'd know she didn't mean it. That was heartbreaking. \n\nAlso, a 4 year sentence? 4 years for that?? 20 years of physical and emotional abuse, doing it in front of small children, then lying about it to police and blaming it all on him. Ridiculous that she basically got a slap on the wrist in the end.",

I think they are being lazy and program ads evey 10 minutes or something because that takes less effort than programming ads to appear between scenes like on network TV. I agree that it is a very obnoxious way to program ads. Netflix has made it clear that they are chasing the Almighty dollar as opposed to creating an excellent user experience. This is the direction nearly every business has gone. When I do find a company that gives a rip about the user experience, you can net money that I'll use them over competitors every time...even if it is more expensive.",

The bonds between people are almost stronger because they aren't formed by superficial things (looks, etc.). And in turn,  the digital world can be less judgemental than the real world for being different, looking different,  seeing the world different. \n\nThis documentary did a fantastic job showing perhaps those who are not part of the gaming community what a true joy it can be and dare I say that it is more than \"just a game\".",

Many positive reviews come from women who thought it was simply a horror movie about being a woman (and did some of the best work showing that feeling I\u2019ve seen).\n\nThe whole time I watched it I kept thinking how amazing a job it was doing of capturing the essence of the feeling of being vulnerable anywhere at any time.  Like, it was a perfect scary movie, to me.  I wonder if a lot of it hit a bullseye for women, but for men who haven\u2019t experienced those feelings, it was boring?",

        "comment_body": "As someone quite familiar with Rodney Alcala\u2019s murder spree, I thought the movie did a good job in its dramatization of Alcala and his crimes including the harrowing survival tale of Monique Hoyt and Cheryl Bradshaw\u2019s infamous close call with him on the reality tv show \u201cThe Dating Game\u201d, an event that led to the coining of his moniker \u201cThe Dating Game Killer\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI appreciated that the filmmakers avoided exploitative and gratuitous violence in their depictions of the victims\u2019 murders, all of whom are real people. I disliked the historical revisionism in the film\u2019s depiction of Alcala\u2019s interactions with Cheryl which followed her encounter with him on the show along with the entirely fictitious subplot centering on a made-up friend of real life victim nurse Georgia Wixted. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nOverall I thought the film was good but not great. I\u2019m happy that it introduced many people to Alcala\u2019s horrific crime spree without glamourizing him and that it\u2019s led many to learn about the known victims and survivors who in addition to Monique include Morgan Rowan and Tali Shapiro. I give the movie a 7 out of 10.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nRest in Peace:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n*Cornelia Crilley\u00a0\u00a0\n\n*Ellen Hover\u00a0\u00a0\n\n*Christine Thornton \u00a0\n\n*Pamela Lambson \u00a0\n\n*Jill Barcomb \u00a0\n\n*Georgia Wixted \u00a0\n\n*Charlotte Lamb \u00a0\n\n*Jill Parenteau\u00a0\u00a0\n\n*Robin Samsoe\u00a0\n\n* and to anyone else who had the misfortune of crossing paths with this monster",
