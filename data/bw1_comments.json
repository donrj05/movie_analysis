(And might even be *true,* even if Pasolini himself didn't realize what he was subconsciously doing.)\n\nBut to the actual point, here's a bit of what is known, and what Pasolini has said:\n\n*On the idea of analogy, Pasolini emphasized his intention of not reproducing exactly a historic, casual Christ, but projecting the present-day society of southern Italy onto that figure, a Christ after 2,000 years of narrative build-up. As he explained:*\n\n\"Along with this method of reconstruction by analogy, we find the idea of myth and epics [...] so when narrating the history of Christ, I did not reconstruct Christ such as he actually was. If I had reconstructed Christ's history as it actually was, I would not have made a religious film, since I am not a believer. I do not think Christ was God's son. I would have made a positivist or Marxist reconstruction if any, so at the best of cases, a life of one of the five or six thousands saints preaching at that moment in Palestine. However, I did not want to do that, I am not interested in profanations: that is just a fashion I loathe, it is *petit bourgeois*. **I want to consecrate things again, because that is possible, I want to re-mythologize them.** I did not want to reconstruct the life of Christ as it really was, I wanted to make the history of Christ plus two thousand years of Christian storytelling about the life of Christ, since it is the two thousands years of Christian history that have mythologized this biography, one that as such would have been virtually insignificant otherwise. My film is the life of Christ after two thousands years of stories on the life of Christ. That is what I had in mind.\"\n\nIn other words, the Marxist viewpoints seem to be imposed more from reviewers/viewers rather than actually being foundational and intended --which seems to be Pasolini's desire:  To create a sincere new evocation of a sacred myth.",

But above all there were many 'flops' that would become notable as years passed. Galaxy Quest, Iron Giant, Arlington Road, Mystery Men, Bowfinger, Deep Blue Sea and 13th Warrior among them. As well as fun movies like South Park, Notting Hill, 10 Things I Hate About You and Stuart Little, that found a niche in pop culture. 94's highlights are remarkable, but there was never a more stacked year than 99, even the flops were quite memorable",

He got a donation of merchandise that had a signed 1st print ANH from John Williams to Mark Hamill. He researched it to find out if authentic and got in touch with him to give it back. \n\nMr. Hamill had lost it and donated some things to the store for retreiving it. That's a one-of-a-kind item that \"should be in a museum!\" - but I think should be in the intended person's collection. :)",

In it though at one point they start talking about John Williams and you can tell how much other composers think so highly of him.  Quincy Jones, Hans Zimmer, and others talk very highly of him.  You might like that documentary as well.\n\nOne of the things they didn't mention in the John Williams doc that I thought they would, was that when they did E.T., Steven recut the film cause there was one piece of music that wasn't fitting right.  So instead of changing the music, Steven changed the movie to fit it.\n\n>Williams was recording the lengthy and complex music for the finale of the film, and he was having difficulty synching the orchestra\u2019s performance to the many precise cuts and beats of the picture edit. After several takes, Spielberg offered to turn off the film and allow Williams to record the music on its own, with exactly the tempi and phrasing he felt the music required. When it was recorded to Williams\u2019 satisfaction, Spielberg then re-cut the end of the film to match this musical performance.",

I've probably seen more horror and gore films than any other genre which is surprising when I stop to think how horrible most of them are. They do entertain on a primitive level and there's no denying how popular they are despite the almost complete radio silence about the films in mainstream entertainment media. \n\nThe Terrifier films aren't that remarkable to me aside from the absolutely brutal and graphic kills in the films. They are doing a great job in the gore department and are innovating new practical effects that B-Horror films have been trying to achieve for 40+ years now. Other than that though, the plots and screenplay are a mess and they almost seem to be making things up as the movie rolls.\n\nI'll keep watching the films though.",

        "comment_body": "First off, I love Albert Brooks and Defending Your Life is one of my favorite movies.  Just sooooo good.  You should also check out Lost In America (although personally it gives me an anxiety attack).\n\nAs far as your question, have you ever checked out Robert Altman's movies?  My two favorite of his are M*A*S*H (not the TV show!!!) and The Player.\n\nM*A*S*H came out in 1970, so it preceded the TV show and was somewhat based on the original novel by Richard Hooker. (Betcha didn't know that it started with a book!!!). Altman brought his style to it, which involves a lot of improv and a lot of characters speaking over each other.  Donald Sutherland is Hawkeye Pierce, Elliott Gould is Trapper John, Tom Skerritt is Duke, Robert Duvall is Frank Burns.  Gary Burghoff played Radar O'Reilly in both the movie and the TV show.  You get to hear the lyrics to \"Suicide is Painless\" which was used as the opening music to the TV show.  The movie was made during the (extremely unpopular) Vietnam War, and even though it's set during the Korean War, there are a lot of anti-war messages throughout the movie.\n\nThe Player was made in the early 90s and is about Hollywood. Also based on a novel.  Tim Robbins leads the cast as a somewhat slimy movie producer who is receiving death threats from a writer that he turned down.  Amid movie studio politics, Tim Robbins' character is trying to figure out who is threatening him and what he should do about it.  Huge cast and a lot of meta-commentary about Hollywood, fame, wealth, etc.  It's another great example of Altman's style as a director, which seems less scripted than improv and more chaotic than planned (in the best way possible).\n\nRobert Altman didn't make a huge number of movies, but the ones he did are worth checking out.  I've always heard that Nashville is amazing, and I need to go watch that soon. \ud83d\ude01",

This will be important at the very end.\u00a0\n\nThe son talks like a kid the whole film, EXCEPT when he gives his testimony of what his dad told him in the car. He speaks like an adult here, and I think it\u2019s because he\u2019s quoting what his dad actually said. It even cuts to his dad saying it. If he was making this up, he\u2019d still sound like a kid, or at least a kid trying to sound like an adult. He doesn\u2019t. If you remember, his dad tells him his dog isn\u2019t always going to be there. I don\u2019t remember exactly what he says here, I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s some alluding to suicidal ideation or \u201cbeing sick\u201d, which would answer whether it was suicide or an accident, but he is clearly actually talking about himself and using the dog as a gentle stand-in as a way to prepare his son for when he won\u2019t be around anymore. So, let\u2019s accept that the dog represents the husband in a way.\u00a0\n\nAt the very end of the film, the dog goes into Sandra\u2019s office while she\u2019s working and lies on the bed. Sandra is happy he does this, and I think even lies down with him iirc. I think this is saying Sandra loved and misses her husband, and would not have killed him.\u00a0",

But he did it in order to negotiate his career.\n\nSo he changed the idea that Michael is reliving the murder of his sister by murdering any teenage girl within reach to just that he's after Laurie because she was his secret sister. I think the reason he added this was so they couldn't make any future sequels without Jamie Lee. If she didn't want to come back, who would Michael chase? Little did he know.\n\nAnd of course he worked on 3 to try to drive the franchise in another direction which didn't work.\n\nThat's not to say that I haven't enjoyed the Halloween franchise on a pure cheese/entertainment level. But I'm not sure if it matters if future sequels canonize just 1 or 1&2. Because either way Michael comes back and kills random people and the townsfolk never quite realize that they can't kill him back because he's not human. 13 movies in and they are still trying to shoot/burn him.",

A biopic like this should take the Rocketman approach to music biopics.

        "comment_body": "The best way to process this movie, to me, is to think of it as a postmodern Mary Poppins.\n\nIn Mary Poppins, Mary actually does some rather shady shit if you think about it. She lies to her employers about what she's been doing with their children, and even gaslights the kids themselves by telling them their memories of what happened are false. Taken at face value, she's kind of awful. But it's okay because we know she's fully in control of the situation, won't let any harm occur, and it's all in service of teaching the family (Mr. Banks in particular) a valuable lesson. Then she leaves when she's no longer needed.\n\nLisa is the same. She's dealing with a couple of hormonal teenage boys who think with their dicks, so she uses sexuality as a tool to manipulate them into character development. She never *actually* gives them what they (think they) want, nor would she, it's all in service of teaching them a lesson. In the end she has pushed them to stand up for themselves, gain some self respect, and enter relationships with a pair of *real* girls their age, not magical fanservice robots. \n\nAnd yeah, it's kinda gross. But the movie is aware of that, look how other characters react to her spending time with them, everyone's weirded out by it. But the central lesson is one of want-vs-need. What Gary and Wyatt *want* is a sexy plaything. What they *need* is to grow the hell up and learn to treat girls (and themselves) with respect. Lisa, like Mary Poppins, knows what she's doing and just employs some sketchy methods of doing so.\n\nAnd it's a trick she plays on the audience as well, themselves probably mostly hormonal teenage boys. They thought they were getting a sexy movie about a fantasy girl who's everything you ever wanted. Surprise, she's actually here to teach you not to be a dipshit.",

Rear nudity and implied nudity had become more and more core common, Psycho even had the sound of a toilet flushing. In 1964 The Pawnbroker engaged in a year long challenge to finally show female breasts exposed and beat down the code in 1965. This was a deathknell for the code. For example the highest grossing film of 1966 was Hawaii which literally had dozens of exposed breasts constantly throughout the picture and that was an infinitely squarer picture then The Graduate.",

In back to the future showing Marty being good with a gun, and the clip from ~~The Good, The Bad, And the Ugly~~ \\*A Fist Full of Dollars, is foreshadowing.  The Hoverboard in the  second movie is a direct callback to skateboarding in the first movie.  It has fulfilled it's purpose throughout the second movie.  It's then a callback again in the third movie, as it's been utilized more than once before.\n\nThe gifts of Galadriel are more apt, as they are akin to gadgets Bond gets from Q.  Nothing given should be extraneous and have a use in the story, which they do.\n\nUnless there is a planned sequel, there isn't going to be a checkov gun as anything in the first movie has to be used in the first movie for it to be narratively worthwhile to include, without a planned sequel.\n\nWhat I find most interesting though, is that The Cherry Orchard - a play by Chekov - features two loaded guns, neither of which are fired.  Seemingly contradicting the whole point of everything placed in a story must be narratively important.  But the fact that they are never fired is thematically important, and firing them would undermine one of the play's main themes.",

        "comment_body": "**The Devil's Bath (2024)** - Amazing film depicting the unending horror of...being alive in the middle ages. Bleak, brutal, and slow. Great production. It's like they sent a documentary team five hundred years into the past to film a Germanic village. It's the embellished and apparently true story (according to ancient records) of a young woman who gets married to a guy in the neighboring village but their marriage hits significant snags and she totally unravels. Mental health in the time of hardcore sustenance living, humors, biles, leeches, and 'teh devil' being used to explain anything negative is, shall we say, very much not a good time. Doubly so as a woman. Dear me. It's a very harsh film. A lot to take in. But like the movie Gwen (2018), there are no horrific elements to it like demons or monsters. Nothing supernatural here. Just humans being humans in impossible situations. So it's in the 'horror' section everywhere but that's just because they need to put it somewhere and that genre fits best. This one'll stick with me for a long time. Its pace is slow so know that going in. The lead actress also did the soundtrack which slaps so that's cool.     \n     \n**Viy (1967)** -  Vivid! The first Soviet-era horror film to be officially released in the USSR. A depiction of an old Russian folk tale about a young, wayward monk who is attacked by a witch and then forced to recite bedside prayers for a dead woman for three nights in a hella-spooky church. Holy ding dongs. Such great imagery! And great colors! The print on Tubi is high quality. If you like some spooky 60s imagery from Russia, this is the one for you. But like The Devil's Bath, it's got a very slow pace. The payoff is great but the leadup takes time. If you know that going in, you'll be fine. Great stuff.",

I was already a bit confused by the decision to make him seem more \"creature-like\" and monstrous, was then baffled that they didn't seem interested in showcasing him at all and allowing viewers to appreciate it (left me assuming it was probably just too bad), and was then even *more* baffled that this version of Dracula was just chilling in a pub at the end. It frankly seemed kind of stupid and cheesy for our main character to just walk out into an empty alleyway with only this creature that he knows can kill in no time flat to close out the film, particularly when the rest of the film didn't quite match that cheesiness to me. They know the thralls are weak to the sun, but then they proceed to seemingly do nothing for an entire day and only start making moves once it's night again. They discovered where Dracula is sleeping but appeared to do literally nothing with that information. There was also something about the framing that I know threw me though my memory there is fuzzier - maybe it was that they leaned a bit into the epistolary nature of Dracula only to immediately drop it or something? Likely some other specifics I'm forgetting, but suffice to say I was unimpressed.\n\nThe basic concept of the story (ie, horror movie based on the Demeter) already seemed like it'd be a tough one to execute well, but the story just ended up being even worse. The leads were likable and had some good moments, but I in no way felt like it made up for the weakness of the story their characters were placed in - all it did was make me feel worse because it demonstrated the wasted potential.",

Scott Westerfield came in hard and it was so incredible as 13 year old girl to read. \n\nBut now? We've had the body positivity movement. Beauty standards have changed from what they were. It felt so hamfisted and cringe as hell to see people say things like \"I want to be pretty\" or \"I'm an ugly\". This movie came out too late to be revolutionary or interesting \n\nThe changes were boring and pointless. The bad cgi was distracting and frustrating.

        "comment_body": "Hey there,\n\nThe original _Godfather_ movie isn't just a masterpiece because it's a good movie (which it definitely is.) It's a masterpiece because there had never been a movie made like it before. You see a handful of movies with similar accolades show up on [such](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theitalianreve.com/the-groundbreaking-movies-in-film-history/amp/) [lists:](https://collider.com/most-groundbreaking-movies-reddit/) _Citizen Kane, The Wizard of Oz, Casablanca, Star Wars, The Matrix, Avatar_, and so on.  A portrayal of organized crime had never been so accurate or nuanced, leading to interesting stories about how the movie was [even made.](https://collider.com/the-godfather-mafia-connection/)\n\nTo appreciate _Godfather II_, one must consider that the original was nominated for _eleven_ Academy Awards. The sequel was released to an incredibly enthusiastic audience only two years later.  The stories of Vito's rise to power juxtaposed over Michael's descent into the criminal world he reluctantly joined, all while trying to keep his family in tact and his ambitions to exit the criminal world simply had never been heard before. Fifty years later, these stories have been rehashed and retold from every angle. It's impossible to watch another groundbreaking movie, _Pulp Fiction,_ (and the predecessor, _Reservoir Dogs_) without seeing Puzo and Coppola's fingers all over them. _Godfather II_ isn't celebrated for being groundbreaking, it simply continues a fascinating story with familiar characters. The same arguments can be made for _Empire Strikes Back_ which is an _excellent_ movie and a worthy successor to the original while not being particularly distinct from the _A New Hope._\n\n>I\u2019m only 18, which might add to the problem, idk.\n\nUltimately, this has a huge impact as well. The life Michael lives in the first movie is entirely relatable to a young adult. The lives Vito and Michael live in the second movie legitimately require a healthy dose of life experience to appreciate the challenges their characters face.  Without a significant amount of life experience, it's impossible to know >!just how a married man who desires children will experience being told by his wife she had an abortion because she thought he was a monster. Or that his own brother gave his enemies detailed instructions that result in his children's house being shot up.!<\n\nMaybe you'll watch in ten years and still not \"get it\" and that's totally fine. I didn't care for either movie when I was 19, but at 25, after serving in the Marines, after being divorced and a single father, after failing out of college, I had substantially more life experience to draw from. There's no need to be in a rush. \n\nFinally, appreciation for high quality film ultimately comes from seeing a _lot_ of high quality films. I spent a year watching 40+ of the Academy Award winning Best Pictures. Some were great, many weren't, but I definitely picked up on how several themes were developed and extended over the decades. \n\nCheers!",

Hence her words flung out of space, like this person sort of arrived in her life from nowhere in particular, but somewhere, like a stroke of luck that has no explanation. It's the only way to explain it. \n\nThe second thing about Therese wanting to ask Carol \"things\" is Therese starting to feel curious and feelings developing on Carol's behalf, but the burgeoning relationship being in that unspoken, preliminary stage, where it is unspoken, but something is brewing. Remember, Carol is a conscious lesbian, so she is probably able to articulate what is going on (to herself), but Therese hasn't quite got the vocabulary for it yet, but she's open & curious & prepared to go down the path to find out. \n\nI can't really answer the question about the letter, but it seems Carol's way to let go, and true love must come at the actions of two willing parties. So, Therese must come of her own volition, as we see in that final scene in the restaurant & Carol knows this. Carol knows that only a true relationship can be born by two equally willing & aware people.",

        "comment_body": "Well, the ask me questions bit IMO is about wanting to let Therese in, to open up to her and be *known*\n\nThe letter is about Carol trying to reframe the pain of their breaking up as something that was always coming, something that Therese will never have a satisfactory answer OR solution to -- which is why Carol mentions that her perception of it may change with time, and how all she can do with her love for Therese is to release her to find love elsewhere -- as opposed to trying to find a way to get back with Carol.\n\nCarol has to try to find ways to make her world work, with her child, with her ex. Therese needs to try to find connection with others and a deeper understanding of herself and the world/circumstances around her. That's what I think Carol means by coming together later.\n\nI must admit, though, that while I loved the performances... I did not like this movie. But I'm in general not super fond of the depressing gay romances being, like, most of what we get to see in cinematic same sex couples. That said, I haven't seen it in a while and wouldn't mind seeing if my opinion could change.",

Then, after all that Margot did for her, she tried to steal Bill, and then she tried to steal the playwright for herself as well.  \n\nAs much as Addison did for her, she lied to him as well. I don't think they were ever married by the way.   The film for me remains top three ever for writing , casting- just absolute perfection. The dialogue to this day is just so bitingly brilliant.

That June I was invited by some friends to go see a late night screening of The Rocky Horror Picture Show at the famous Landmark Nuart Theater on Santa Monica Blvd.\n\nAfter the movie, as I\u2019m heading to my car, this \u201cregular Joe\u201d walks up to me & plainly asks if I like scary movies. I say \u201cyes\u201d and ask him \u201cwhy\u201d?\n\nHe proceeds to hand me a VHS tape without a cover, nor any kind of label. Just a plain, ordinary, consumer black VHS tape \u2026\n\nI found this suspicious, especially since I\u2019d only been living in la la land for roughly six months. So obviously, I ask him what\u2019s on the tape?\n\nHe proceeds to tell me that it\u2019s footage shot by some students that got lost in the backwoods somewhere in Maryland that were trying to film a documentary. He went on to say that those students went missing & were never found, but these tapes were! \n\nAt first I was thought it was a joke & asked him; if they found the tapes, but not the students, then what\u2019s at the end of the tapes?\n\nHe said, their last recorded moments alive \u2026\n\nI was stunned, horrified & still not fully comprehending what he was telling me, but being a overly cautious la la land newbie; I quickly followed up with \u2026\n\nWhy on earth would any rationally sane, loving parent ever allow such tapes to be made into a VHS tape, let alone a movie?!\n\nHe abruptly cut me off saying that the story was on the internet, I could look it up myself when I got home (pre-iPhone-era for you youngsters) and more importantly to bring awareness & visibility to said story in hopes of finding their children.\n\nAt the time, his explanation made enough sense to me, coupled with morbid curiosity \u2026 I took the tape.\n\nSo I get back to my apartment in Hollywood; pop in the tape, late night & alone.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing but static for like 10-15 seconds & then this \u2026\n\n\u201cIn October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary.\n\nA year later, their footage was found.\u201d\n\nCue movie \u2026\n\nThe raw psychological & emotional fear I felt watching the next hour and half of this VHS tape was beyond visceral. I was truly afraid for those students & horrified at what I was watching!\n\nAs soon as it was over, I immediately hopped onto Netscape to see what I could find & sure enough \u2026\n\nThere were multiple websites, with various accounts of what I had just watched with pictures of the students, location information on where they went missing, the whole nine yards!\n\nThis made the fear & anxiety over what I had just witnessed even worse!\nSo much so, that I had reoccurring nightmares that lasted almost a week. I just couldn\u2019t get the story & images out of my head.\n\nAnd because of this, I told every single person that would listen to me about what I saw. I made my girlfriend watch it & she did the same thing. \n\nTold everyone she she knew \u2026\n\nI told my little brother, who was 16 at the time, about this movie that was coming out and that it was a true story. He believed me because I was so serious & also because his older brother, who just finished college, would never lie to him \u2026\n\nNeedless to say, when the movie finally came out & was shortly thereafter debunked; I was relieved that it wasn\u2019t true, but fascinated by being \u201cgotten\u201d via a marketing campaign!\n\nWhat really stood out though was the people that saw the movie knowing it was fake going in, found the movie \u201cnot scary\u201d, but the people who didn\u2019t know found it \u201cscary\u201d & then there was me \u2026\n\nTraumatized to this day because of an old, blank, VHS tape, the internet & a brilliant movie marketing campaign!",

It's a film about a family deluding themselves into believing they're doing the right thing, and the atmosphere really hits home the fact that they are alone, delusional, and have no idea how to be normal human beings.

Worth checking. \n\nThe Kaboom episode of Parks and Recreation fits this assignment very well\u2014and is also a hilarious gamble by the real nonprofit Kaboom!\n\nDolphin Tale (2011) has a surprisingly nuanced perspective of a wildlife rescue with a good example of the \u201cone fundraiser will save this organization\u201d trope.\n\nThe Cider House Rules (1999) is about an orphanage in the 1930s and 40s where an obstetrician also performs abortions. There\u2019s a scene with the orphanage board which might be interesting for this assignment! \n\nTheater Camp (2023) is about saving a theater foundation.\n\nShallow Hal (2001) has a decent subplot about volunteering on the pediatric burn unit.\n\nAlso, checkout this great overview of the TV Trope, rich philanthropist: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WealthyPhilanthropist",

No idea how popular _that_ take might be.\n\n\nWhile the Thing 2011 was just a baffling waste of a great concept - I still think you could make a good sequel, it just needs transplanting to another isolated location (oil rig, an island etc) to really run with the original\"s tone of being utterly alone and trapped.",

I'd argue that it actually does improve on the first trilogy by actually showing us Charles and Eric's relationship before they became adversaries.

To top it all off the location of Tallinn, Estonia of which where most of the movie was filmed had a chemical plant nearby that was dumping chemical waste into the streams which caused the director, his wife and assistant director as well as one of the least actors to develop a rare form of lung cancer that would later takes their lives.

Then I passed on the love of the character to my brother, who's an even bigger fan. \n\nSuch an amazing character who's gone through so many iterations. From being a serious metaphor about the dangers of nuclear warfare to becoming a goofy superhero than becoming more of an anti-hero. \n\nIts cool to see that now we have 2 different interpretations of the character happening at the same time. I'm interested to see where Toho takes the character since they've brought him back to being an antagonistic force of nature. I presume they transition him more into an anti-hero fighting off against other Kaiju but still having beef with the humans. \n\nWhile the Legendary Godzilla is still serious, the films have more of a cheesy/action tone. I am interested to see if they start to turn the movies into more of a serious  tone.",

It's more like how most people spend their time visiting another place. \n\nThey spend it pretty close to home base locations, only driving out a little bit to do a thing they've decided on. They spend it stationary far more often than they're in transit. They spend it amongst each other, talking and reflecting.\n\nThe camera isn't prone to breaking the points of view that a human being could have, because it's you, the viewer, who is there with the characters. It's not fly on the wall or birds eye because the viewer is not a fly or a bird.\n\nAnd the shot isn't static for too long because people don't focus on one thing exclusively in a real life \"scene\", even if it's the most interesting thing. The eye checks in on the other people to gauge the reactions and get a read on the vibe, to keep social engagement active, or continue to view mundane things also, just because our eye wants variety, and that's what else is there to see.\n\nThe result: You feel like you've been to those places and spent time with those people.

Culturally too, France is pretty different in terms of admiration for what are considered to be 'great' artists and intellectuals.\n\nWelles was probably flattered that French filmmakers 'recognized' him more than in the US, but also alarmed and put off by the *style* of their admiration.\n\nWelles here admits he is a 'paradoxical' figure, but having read some of his long musings on other filmmakers, he seemed to lean in towards respect for those old Hollywood filmmakers who probably went overboard with modesty, hated pretentiousness and presented themselves as craftsmen and not 'artistes' (John Ford is one example of this).\n\nIts paradoxical because Welles really  was extreme in going between the 'artiste' and the 'craftsman'. In the days of his  youthful prime he was widely villanized as an artsy, pretentious young show off. Possibly as he got older he felt genuinely wounded by that and swung in the other direction.\n\nIt also bears mention that as a kid it still would have been silent movie days and theater more represented 'high art'. There was not as much of a body of films for him to be influenced by in the first place. He probably spent a lot of his boyhood reading books and the plays of shakespeare.",

I didn\u2019t read too much into this but I do think it\u2019s interesting. Possibly Alonzo was already planning to scapegoat Jake somehow and this made things more personal.

I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s just some bullshit and he\u2019s more just learning about Jake in terms of how he reacts and engages in conversation, as sort of a habit to feel people out.\n\n4. My take is he was making sure that jacking Roger later was going to be an option in the event the 3 wise men sanctioned it.\n\n5. Some people argue he was a cop, but I don\u2019t think so.

Personally I feel a little disappointed that it was only a 'partial' biography - Lee Miller lived several other fascinating lives before this one and they are only barely alluded to. It's a slightly claustrophobic experience as there's only minimal personal interaction. Other things which grate a little for me are the cardboard cutout caricature of Audrey Withers - it's hard to take her seriously - and, bluntly, that Kate Winslet, whilst a fine actress, is too old for the role - what a pity she wasn't asked to do it ten or fifteen years ago. There are many positives to offset this though. The horrors of war are powerfully conveyed through the characters' reactions rather than graphically, and to great effect. The visual aesthetic is uncannily faithful to Miller's photographic work. If you can lay your hands on a copy of \"Lee Miller's War\" flick through the pages and you'll find yourself back in the movie again instantly.",

Anyone that has ever been in high stress situations know that when people are desperate and scared are not nearly as good at decision making as people that are watching movies on their couches.\n\nFor instance, I used to work at a gas station. One night we were busy. A guy and his buddy pulled up to the gas pump and walked inside and waited inline. When they got to the front of the line, they asked if we had a fire extinguisher. I asked why, they said because their trunk was on fire, and sure enough there was smoke coming out of it. \n\nAs the very wise K once said \"A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky dangerous animals and you know it\"",

Almost all them are variations of one of the original dilemmas she faces, when she agrees to find an apartment with her best friend, when she clearly has no intention of following through.\n\nShe learns over and over that her words and actions have consequences beyond what she intends. In Seymour\u2019s life especially, she is a fucking tornado of chaos. Enid only thinks she\u2019s playing a game, in her weird way. But everyone else is actually living life. She hasn\u2019t yet made the connection that the games she\u2019s engaging in are, in fact, life itself.\n\nI think that by the end of the movie, she is beginning to realize her impact and what she did to cause the havoc and the irreparable harm to important relationships in her life. Those bridges have been burned; those relationships are gone. The bus is simply a metaphor that she will carry these lessons with her and (hopefully) act in a more responsible way in the future.\n\nThese are lessons that almost every young person needs to learn. I certainly did.\n\nSidenote: just before she gets on the bus at the end, a strip mall is shown. It has a Popeyes on one end and a Radio Shack on the other. In between is a place called Mario\u2019s Peruvian Seafood. This strip mall is on the corner of Melrose and Vine in Hollywood. The Popeyes and Radio Shack are long gone, but Mario\u2019s survives. I love Mario\u2019s. Their saltado is one of my favorite things I\u2019ve ever eaten. If you\u2019re ever close by, drop in!",

        "comment_body": "I won't comment on the film's ending, but here are my thoughts about its *beginning*:\n\nI want to break down why this sequence is so effective in setting up its background mood of \"loneliness,\" which is pitched against the film's main young character, who's trying to discover a way to live with vitality.\n\nHere's the OPENING:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUvqE-4LhSU\n\nIn this terrific title sequence, the key effect is born out of the contrast between the liveliness of the imaginary world being broadcast in the old movie playing on the TV (a 1965 Indian/Bollywood film called **Gumnaan**) and the loneliness on display in several different apartments in the same building.\n\nFirst, the camera arrives at a window where an Indian woman isn't watching the movie at all.  The blue light of the TV is flickering on her face as she stares out her window, listening to the music; which gives us a feeling of reverie, like she's recalling her past life in that foreign world, remembering, perhaps, a youth full of vibrancy and joy before she became a lonely middle-aged woman.\n\nThe next window gives us a heavyset man sitting at his kitchen table, shirtless, unkempt, picking his teeth, reading a magazine for entertainment.  Again:  All alone.\n\nThe next apartment is completely empty of life, but there are the remains of a single meal at a table that should accommodate an entire family, along with an exercise bike that makes you imagine the absent inhabitant peddling it, alone in this room, going nowhere.\n\nThe next window gives a glimpse of a different kind of loneliness, one born of familiarity and indifference, as we see a married couple, overweight couch potatoes, sitting side by side watching the TV, not moving a muscle; as their devil child beats his Big Wheel with a baseball bat and they just ignore him.\n\nThen we arrive at the main character's apartment.  Enid's apartment is colorful, idiosyncratic, the walls covered in movie and art posters, creativity on display everywhere.  And this young girl, although alone, is completely connected to that 1965 \"Ghost World\" Indian movie, the wonderful creative energy of another place and time playing on her TV; and she dances along to its music, not in the least bit moody like every other person we've seen so far.\n\nIt's a fly sequence, done without pretense, and it's quite lovely; as is the entire movie.",

Meanwhile the agents\u2019 platonic relationship, always professional, always tender, burns almost to the point of bright molten lava.",

Throughout the short history of Hollywood so many times \"the end\" was speculated with the emergence of TV, Reality TV boom in 2000 was supposed to be a death knell for scripted content on tv, then streaming, smart phones were going to signal the end of movie theatres.\n\nI think there's grains of truth but personally, I think that one of the biggest issues is fear of taking risks, over saturation with big blockbusters, cinematic universes instead of smaller budget comedies, dramas, horror, sci-fi, fantasy, western, independent, art house films.\n\nOver the last TWENTY YEARS I see so MANY remakes, reboots, revivals, re-imagining of live action Disney movies, well known IPs, brands, franchises but with very little thought or creativity behind it other then name value or recognition.\n\nIt feels like Studios, executives and the industry are afraid to try, to take risks or be blind sighted when they throw all their chips into streaming but don't have the forethought to put every single bit of the library on, not promoting and wanting people to pay $14-20 for the no adds model when every month titles just disappear without warning.\n\nSo I don't know? With the rise of A.I. there is concern but it just feels like another example of going ALL IN on the next big thing without thinking it through. I remember in 2007 when they started giving talent contracts to big name YouTubers only to let them expire because they realized that people with no formal training despite how creative they are with skits, music videos, commentaries can't just transition seamlessly.",

But it's not a courtroom drama, it's not even really about the other jurors, it's a lumbering character piece that leaves you thinking.

For the big chains, having a central contract with large, established distributor is relatively easy to maintain. There'll be plenty of copies manufactured that enable the simultaneous screening at multiple sites.\n\nThe lower budgets of indie arthouse flicks also include them typically not having as many prints made, so only a smaller number of theatres can rent it at any particular time. For rural backwater privately operated movie houses, that means waiting in line till it's available, and then hoping enough people show up to watch it that they'd make a profit. On top of that risk of losing money from poor attendances, it's much more work identifying what to screen when they aren't being released through the main distributors. It needs a deep passion and huge stamina, but businesses also need to be financially solvent.",

As Monstro Elisue, Elisabeth finally embraces her appearance fully, and heads back to the NYE taping and enters the stage with a finally unrestrained glee, only to be ridiculed and attacked by the crowd, who represent society and also us, the literal audience, and our infatuation with impossible beauty standards. After an entire movie of trying to become beautiful again, she is finally content with herself, despite the crowd\u2019s horror, and she thwarts the audience and their visceral reaction to her appearance by dousing them in absolutely insane amounts of explosive blood and gore, bathing them in it, before she finally settles onto her star on the walk of fame with a smile on her face. Quite uplifting, don\u2019t you think? Lol\n\nThe film is fantastically shot, directed, edited and acted. It\u2019s darkly hilarious and so extremely unsubtle in its presentation of its themes that I found it actually refreshing. Meaning can be presented in different ways, and I appreciated its over-the-top, stylized nature. It\u2019s something that feels on paper like it shouldn\u2019t really work, and in lesser hands, it wouldn\u2019t have. Fargeat is one to continue to watch out for, and her first feature Revenge is also quite good.",

He\u2019s wearing boxers so he can\u2019t have any pads on his legs, and apparently he just threw himself down the stairs on the first take. The result looked incredible, and the crew was just speechless as a result. And then from the back Fincher shouts \u201cAgain from the top!\u201d or something like that.\u00a0\n\nApparently Fincher had that guy fall down those stairs take after take after take, but ultimately the first take made the movie.\n\nIf you get a chance, watch Fight Club with the commentary from Fincher, Pitt, and Norton, as Pitt tells the story when that scene comes up.",

He then went on to have his assistant \"guess\" people's credit card numbers, relative's names, hidden jewelry. Shit was wild. It's frustrating bc you know there's a trick but you can't figure out 100% how they're doing it.

I do wish that one Cardinal had been kept as Filipino rather than from the Americas.\n\nI'm not familiar with the actor playing Tedesco, so I imagined it's Mel Gibson, who is famously anti- Vatican II.",

Every lesson learned from the first movie is thrown out, and some notes are just retconned (for example, Bob Parr was a great dad in the first movie who only hated his cubicle job. Suddenly, he's tweaking worse than ever before when he has to... spend time with his children.). But, on its surface, it's a good standalone story: Superhero comes out of retirement to promote heroes, has to deal with a foe who's trying to besmirch the value of superheroes once and for all. Actions scenes and a sprinkling of comedy ensue.\n\nAlso, this is a small thing that I find hilarious: In The Fantastic Four- a movie most people agree is shit- there's a scene where Doom (the villain) traps Reed Richards (the Elastic Man) in a hypercooled room to prevent him from using his powers, and Doom explains his plan in great detail. In FF, this scene is amazingly pointless and only exists so the viewer understands the plan. The Incredibles is often considered \"Fantastic Four if it didn't suck\" due to the similarity of powers among the heroes. They then proceeded to redo this FF scene almost to-the-letter in Incredibles 2. It's just as stupid. In fact, it's even more stupid because it has 10 years of hindsight to tell the directors that it's a bad scene.",

This response was not an endorsement of the joke's initial premise but rather a reaction to how poorly the material had aged.\"\n\nReally?  The writer thinks the entire audience was laughing about 'how poorly the material had aged'?  Not everyone is a movie critic dude.  \n\n\"If a filmmaker tried to mine comedy from suicidal ideations in the year 2024, they would promptly be escorted out of Hollywood, perhaps forever. However, if this joke comes from a beloved 1950s classic, I guess this line is ridiculous for how cinematic humor has changed over the past six decades.\"\n\nYes, humor has changed, but suicide is still a topic used in recent movies.

The plot will also find room to take in the work of Robert Stigwood, a music mogul and film producer who managed both the Bee Gees and another hugely successful group of the time, Cream. \n\n> \u201cI want to see people of the time \u2013 I want a bit of Jimi Hendrix and the other bands of the time,\u201d Scott told us. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a very good period with Robert Stigwood through the 60s and 70s. Robert Stigwood, without question, was talented at spotting bands, but he also was big on theatre production, and he also did pretty well with a film called Saturday Night Fever, and Grease as well.

But when someone does - which of course happens - it splits the timeline again.

Jake's consciousness is sent back in time into Sean's brain and each time it is a new timeline but each time he dies he goes back to the original timeline and is able to communicate details of his investigation to them. At the end he is in an alternate timeline with no explosion and decides to stay in Sean's body. At first he believes that after 8 minutes the simulation will end but it doesn't, and that means it wasn't a simulation. Also he messages alternate timeline's Vera Farmiga to help the Jake in this timeline. Because in this timeline they didn't need to use the source code since the first bombing was averted and the bomber caught early. So that timeline's jake and Vera and Jeffrey wright are still waiting for an opportunity to use the source code. \n\nThey went for a more feel good ending. But it is kind of messed up for Sean the poor teacher who basically dies in this alternate timeline and Michelle's character is going to fall for an imposter.\n\nEdit: I believe there is a scene where he finds out that he is supposed to be dead from an internet search or something. How does that work if the simulation is based on dead people's memory? Nobody googled Jake's military history.",

Which is a bad look locally and internationally. Now some folks are going to get curious and want to see what the \"banned\" content is about.\n\nSeriously though, trust your own people. Most are going to watch this movie and come out thinking ... \"okay, so what?\" Because most Singaporeans are happy the country chose to separate from Malaysia, and nearly all are happier living in a capitalist society.

Do you think Star Wars would have survived for as long as it has if it wasn't for the toys, books, and games? Cartoons of the 80s are often criticized for being 20 min toy commercials, but the quality of animation and writing had to be there to keep the interest of children, which in turn fueled the desire to own the toys, clothing, games, etc. That merchandise, including home video media, kept franchises like Transformers going for 40 years. The original '86 Transformers film was a box office failure but became a beloved classic after home video release (and as fans grew up to appreciate what the film was). I hope with Transformers One, now that it's on the on-demand Streaming (and when it eventually goes to free streaming) that fans young and old will realize how good it is and that feedback with encourage a sequel and then more people will go to the theater rather than dismiss it so easily like they did with TF One",

The 30s adaptation, for obvious reasons, greatly compresses the timeline of the story cause that\u2019s when shit kicks off. In the book he falls into madness much more gradually. He is imo, far more sympathetic, pitiable, and almost understandable in the book. The 30s movie is very limited by both its runtime and the primitive special effects, but it is one of the better Universal Monster flicks.\n\nHollow Man makes the Invisible Man into a pervert rapist and it devolves into a big dumb action flick in the 3rd act. Great special effects for the time though.\n\nThe Invisible Man 2020 is a great film in its own right, but it\u2019s not an adaptation of the novel. It\u2019s an original story that uses the basic concept of a man becoming invisible and has nothing to do with the book or is anything like previous adaptations.\n\nThe Invisible Man needs to be a miniseries, maybe 3-4 hour long episodes to faithfully adapt the novel.",

The practical effects are mind-blowing for the era. It's wild to think about the creativity involved in making someone seem invisible without modern tech!",

People got raptured because God knew that end of the World is coming?  Only other explanation would be, that Aliens wanted to keep some humans safe. They did not want to eradicate all our species. \n\n\\- They got killed by some sort of self defense systems of fourth asteroid. Their F-16s were obliterated when they launched nuclear attack on incoming asteroid (probably some sort of ship). \n\n\\- There were supposed to be three survivors. But either humans never found Beijing's survivor or Chinese government kept his existence as secret. That's why were unable to decipher their message. Aliens were probably unable to speak our language, if they even had capability to speak. So they kidnapped three people and brainwashed them to repeat our own message from Voyager Two. It was their attempt to communicate and give us sing of their peaceful intentions.",

The public isn't terribly good at doing that.\n\n\nMovies, you can say that the Avengers is a good fun movie...and you can objectively remove \"points\" for the lack of a good musical score for such and epic movie.  I would.\n\n\n\nOne of my favorite movies of all time is Big Trouble in Little China.   Great, fun, acting fits the tongue-in-cheek plot - fast dialog, good effects - culturally questionable - well directed with a very 80s vibe (Carpenter so yeah!) musical score.   It's one of my favorites, but lets be real - the costumes are meh almost cliche, the comedy is shlock that some won't appreciate, the action is just meh (Jackie Chan is cringing)....my soul say it's a 10/10, my logic says it's more like a 6.5/10 - and I'd probably give it a 7.5 cuz it's got charm.  \n\n\nI don't like Kill Bill...feels like violence for violence sake and could have been half as long.   There's moments where it's great, and the direction and camera work are great...I have a problem with the plot in general and so don't like the movie.   I'd still give it about the same 7.5/10 as Big Trouble above.  For very different reasons.\n\nAlternately, I think you have to see Inglorious Basterds for just 2 scenes, the opening one with Christoph Waltz is perfection of writing and acting, and the bar scene later in the movie.  Suspense like few movies ever get to...music was eh ok...but I didn't need any of the other scenes, still it's worth the entire wait for those scene.   Beyond that it's typical Tarantino violence and dialog that makes it special but I could leave that.   8.7/10 just for those 2 scenes.   And my rating tells you what you need to know...it's must see.\n\n\nA bad review... Furious, pales in comparison to any previous Mad Max movie.   50% of the scenes are CG (Miller must have listened too much to his whining actors on the last movie)...Ana Taylor Joy is cast completely wrong and doesn't look like she could hurt a fly even before you put makeup and stunt people to work.  Pretty boy Chris Hemsworth is too pretty for the wasteland and still sounds too pompous by far for someone who would be killing folk in the next scenes.   The stuntmen are to be commended for their work all the same, and the editing is fantastic as it was in the last film.   Not nearly gritty enough, and Miller should know better.   Music is forgotten easily.  5.5/10 \n\n\nMaybe you don't agree with me but you know why I rate.  This is how you rate things.   You have reasons... to back up a rating.\n\n\n\nIf I just go based on what I like watching over and over again:\n\nBack to the Future - 10/10\nDunkirk - 10/10\nChristmas Vacation - 10/10 \nBorderlands 0/10\n\n\nThis is not useful to do it like that, but the world is full of stupid people and you have to wade thru it.\n\n\n\nWhat you probably feel is the BS marketing team over-selling and astro-turfing ratings on new movies and how bad those ratings are.   And then the over-reaction from 14yrs olds.     You also shouldn't let a rating define your thoughts on a movie.   Make up your own mind...though if you are wondering if something is good or not to go see...a well written review/rating should tell you something about WHY it's good.",

It was the early days of the internet and marketing for this film was probably something you could only get away with once. I don't think I *really* believed it was real, but I'd never seen a found footage movie before, and piecing together what was going on without ever getting the full story was very creepy. I've never watched it again, and if I went back I probably wouldn't rate it, but it's hard to overstate how much of a phenomenon it was at the time.",

Modern tech is able to capture all the details and you can restore a lot in post production, old tech had \"this or that\", what's not on film doesn't exist.\n\nRemember that digital filming tech and high definition with lots of pixels and detail is a very recent invention that just made it to the market in the last 20 years.",

I don't know what people below are talking about. Both movies are CLEARLY about addiction and how it manifests, RFAD taking heroin as its \"substance\" and The Subtance using beauty measures and basically anything we become reliant on to maintain unattainable beauty standards. There were many nights of my own heroin addiction where I put tons of makeup on my grey, pale skin and made sure I met the beauty standards and no one knew I was literally decaying underneath that. The connections between the two movies cannot be understated, including the style of cinematography, the pacing, the rising crescendo of tension, and the normalization and routinization of insane things we do to survive and cope in a modern world.

It's kind of an inescapable thing when it comes to art in particular. Personally, as I get older I love movies more and more because I have learned to appreciate more about movies over time. Sometimes the criteria is, \"That was fun to watch\" without much else. I am much less picky and enjoy the ride. It's easy to find things to like about movies, but for some it's a lot easier to focus on what isn't good about them. I could probably be a pretty rough critic, but I choose not to because it sucks all the fun out of just enjoying it. If you can't enjoy a light hearted romcom, or a blockbuster action movie, you really have no place to critique anything at all. Again, this is my opinion so who cares.",

I've been a gamer for as long as I can remember and it was just so touching to see the force of good that gaming can bring to people. It's not all violence and zombies! I've been having this argument with my family and friends for years. The most tragic scenes that had me crying  were when Mats would log on and run the same route each session. If we just take a moment to understand how much meaning that held to him, the sense of freedom and something we as most gamers don't pay much attention to the running from A to B.",

        "comment_body": "Hey! My highest compliments on the film! As a 20 year wow vet, it definitely got me emotional and thinking about how I haven't made the effort to make or maintain relationships in the game for many years. I then logged in after being gone for a few weeks, and someone in this guild I've just raided with a few times said they were glad to see me/that I was OK. Maybe they had just watched the film too haha, but anyway, I was moved by the whole experience so thank you!\n\nMy question is: I'm confused about where all Starlight's logs came from. Guild chat I understand, but did they do all their RP in guild chat? Or were they recording all their stuff manually? Was it an add-on? I'm thinking about the records of conversations they must have had in whispers and all that. I'm assuming there's some combination of actual logs and just people's recollections but I'm just curious about the breakdown of all that. \n\nOne last comment about the film: I loved the machinima animation so much. Especially the facial expressions. Wish they looked like that in-game! Lol. I've probably seen some of Rasmus' machinima work over the years and I've always been so impressed by what's possible - and the scenes for this film are obviously best-in-class in that regard. \ud83c\udfc6 Hope the team is very proud and receives all the praise and exciting offers you deserve.\n\nCheers!",

        "comment_body": "Hi! I just wanted to thank you for the incredible care you put into Mats\u2019 story. I\u2019ve played WoW for 18 years, and this year, my son started playing with me. Like Mats, my son has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. He\u2019s nine, still able to get around, but starting to slow down. He recently got measured for his first wheelchair since distances are getting tougher. He doesn\u2019t know this disease will eventually take his life, but he does know he\u2019ll need his chair full-time one day. For a kid his age, that\u2019s already a lot to process.\n\nWhen he tells us he wants to play sports, it\u2019s painful to have to tell him that it\u2019s just not possible. We do our best to offer alternatives, suggesting different activities or ways he can still be involved, but it\u2019s hard not to feel the constant weight of guilt. There\u2019s guilt for not being able to fix what\u2019s happening to him, for not having the answers to explain why, and for feeling like we\u2019re always asking him to accept a compromise.\n\nWe make sure he knows how much we admire him and how proud we are for everything he faces with such resilience. He carries more than any child should, and we\u2019re amazed by his strength every day.\n\nGaming has helped him connect with us and share things he couldn\u2019t before. In these games, he learned to tell us what he needs, which opened a way for us to talk with him about real-life challenges. WoW has been especially helpful for him to manage his frustrations while still having fun. His favorite part is getting a new mount and flying all over Azeroth, exploring every corner he can reach.\n\nIt\u2019s not just WoW, though. Fortnite has been a big influence, especially in learning to read. Reading never really clicked for him, but he was determined to complete his missions. We would ask him what he thought the text said and promised to help as long as he tried. For the first time, he put in that effort consistently, and it made a difference.\n\nNow, with the wheelchair coming soon, he\u2019s already focusing on the bright side. He\u2019s excited to \u201cfinally be faster\u201d than his little brother and is making plans on how he\u2019ll trap his brother with his new wheels.\n\nDuchenne is a rare disease, and although I tell people my son has muscular dystrophy, many don\u2019t fully understand how it affects him and his life. Since this documentary came out, I see my son in Mats, and I finally see people listening and beginning to understand. \n\nI don\u2019t have a question, just a heartfelt thank you. WoW has been so much more than just a game over the years, and seeing its impact captured this way is such a gift. Thank you for showing what it can mean to families like ours.",

I am curious whether the production of this documentary had played a role in getting the memorial added to the game. Had you reached out to Blizzard directly to discuss having Ibelin's tombstone added to the game? Are Ibelin's friends and family aware of its addition to the game? I think it's very lovely that World of Warcraft has so many different shrines and references to its players and their characters, I would love to know more about the process that allows these things to eventually find their way into the game.",

The idea of ending a film on a cliffhanger at the time was pretty novel, but at the same time it wasn't some earth-shattering new invention, either: although George Lucas had already concieved the cliffhanger ending before it was released, Ralph Bakshi's Lord of the Rings from 1978 ended with a cliffhanger of sorts.\n\nPeople did have a degree of heads-up because Empire Strikes Back was developed as part of a trilogy: the name for the third film, then still called Revenge of the Jedi, was known before Empire Strikes Back even wrapped filming. So Lucas - even though he didn't really plan ahead plot-wise very much - could approach it as a *sort of* two-parter.",

Star Wars to be a 9 chapter epic was mind-blowing when it was revealed after the fact, never mind the notion of it when he first started. Jedi wrapped things up in a bow, because at the time it wasn't feasible to do them all, but of course we know where things ended up decades later...\n\nSeason ending cliffhangers were common in TV culture at the time, primarily for soaps. But for movies it was very rare. That we had to wait three years for resolution of the cliffhanger was both torture and brilliant.\n\nEDIT: I remember when BTTF dropped, was a massive hit and was all but assured a sequel before release due to the closing scene. But when its was revealed that they were actually doing two of them, and filming them back to back was also pretty revolutionary at the time.",

He\u2019s now also a fish out of water in Portland, Maine, having recently moved with his girlfriend, Wendy (Kelly O\u2019Sullivan, SAINT FRANCES), to be closer to her parents. Without a job or a plan, and with a new dog competing for Wendy\u2019s affections, Walt has reached peak anxiety. When Wendy leaves town for the most important business trip of her career, she entrusts Walt with one task: taking care of her fur baby, Tony. After a careless mistake gets Tony stolen, Walt embarks on a wild goose chase to retrieve the dog before Wendy returns, or risk losing them both. Along the way, he connects with locals Marianne (Barbara Rosenblat, ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK), a wisecracking nonconformist, and Brent (Steve Coulter, OPPENHEIMER, A LITTLE PRAYER), a recent widower, who force him to confront his anxieties and embrace human (and canine!) connection.\n\nTrailer: [https://youtu.be/1C0ed98jijg](https://youtu.be/1C0ed98jijg)\n\nMore Info and How to Watch: [https://hangdogmovie.com/](https://hangdogmovie.com/) \n\nAsk us anything!

Since Edward is basically AI inside of a robot shell, it\u2019s one of those situations of the AI being both incredibly smart in some ways and incredibly dumb in others. The best that can be said is that Edward has a childlike innocence that guides his AI curiosity. It\u2019s the way many writers choose to portray AI robots because it allows a robot the leeway to become murderous, but completely fail to understand the consequences of that action. Most robots portrayed in this \u201cinnocent\u201d way lack any form of a moral compass.",

I think Hitchcock was a real master of ambient sound (no musical score with the only music being played in the movie) and I think he was at his best at The Birds. I feel the soundtrack in Psycho kind of spoils the scary moments because it's telling you to be scared. In The Birds there's no soundtrack to guide your emotions so you're always on edge. Probably one of the scariest scenes in the movie is when Melanie is waiting outside the schoolhouse and the children are singing Risseldy Rosseldy and the birds begin to perch on the playground behind her. I feel a score would've diminished the horror of moments like those. It also makes the whole thing feel more real.",

Baker has a finely tuned story sense\u2014the machine runs efficiently, and the characters are essentially workers enlisted to keep it running. Their emotional lives don\u2019t factor into the movie except to the extent that they serve the cause; there\u2019s no side chatter, no offhand conversation, and they don\u2019t break the framework of their function to delve deep into experiences, memories, ambitions, dreams, and ideas.\"\n\nHere, he's saying that the characters are \"one-dimensional\" in that they only exist to drive the plot forward, like how machines have a single operational purpose. By and large, he's saying in a  roundabout way that they don't feel like real, fleshed out people, but characters on a page brought straight to the screen.\n\n> \"The characters move within even the grittiest spaces as if walking past backdrops or C.G.I. green screens. What\u2019s missing from \u201cAnora\u201d isn\u2019t the characters\u2019 physical contact with locations but their mental contact. Baker never lets them express what they know or think about the places they inhabit.\" \n\nSame point really for this excerpt. He's saying that the characters don't have a connection with the material or with the story. They're tools to communicate the plot and that's all they're good for.\n\nNot to say that I agree/disagree with him, but IMO that's the point he is trying to get across about the movie. I haven't seen the film, so I can't comment on my opinion, but if I was to parse out what he's saying, that would be how I do it.",

As he mentions, no character is explicitly talking about their dreams and ambitions.\n\nBut I disagree that the script is artificial, and also with the implication that the film itself is superficial. With the main character in particular, a lot of subtext is bubbling beneath the surface if you pay close attention to Madison\u2019s performance and how she reacts verbally and nonverbally as the film progresses. The final sequence ties everything together. There is a reason this won the Palme D\u2019or and is otherwise critically acclaimed. \n\nOf note, Richard Brody also had a lukewarm review for Oppenheimer last year.",

It\u2019s like all the gaudy moments of Euphoria without any of the moments which give the plot and characters dimension.

Some people call it a \"good for her\" type story, which I can understand. But for me, it felt more like a cautionary tale about the dangers of compartmentalizing your negative feelings/impulses to the point that they start to manifest more aggressively and control you, like Laura's outburst during rehearsal or of course the ending. Sort of a unique mix of Beauty and the Beast and Falling Down.

(Which proves the point of the Book) Considering that the genre of the story falls within Alternate History, i would agree with u/matlockga about Japan possibly winning WWII (I haven't read the manga yet so it may happened many times with the said 55th Battle Royale Act, it could be Canon or Otherwise.) \n\nThe Battle Royale happened 4 times in the first story, In the Movie, we see the Girl with the plush who survived Battle Royale making it the first, second one is the Kawada killing his Girlfriend to survived, The Third Battle Royale is where we see the Protagonist Nanahara and the Kawada returning.\n\n3 years after the terrorist massacre, they introduced another theme of BR act but instead of the Death tournament, they'll use the students who are unexperienced in combat and will be deployed to take down Wild Seven league and The Leader Nanahara, Making it the 4th Battle Royale.",

That's not even mentioning the CGI issues and the poorly done story and plot elements to support the CGI issues. People care about quality and NO ONE likes bad CGI. \n\nPhasing out the major long standing characters and their actors also did enormous damage to the franchise. RDJ's Iron Man, SJ's Black Widow, CE's Captain America were the heavy hitters and all were gone in a single movie. They also ended up axing Vision and then Wanda a movie or so later. The MCU basically fell down and never figured out how to get back up. Who cares about continuity and sequels and shared universe when most of the characters you cared about are gone. \n\nDC never figured their stuff out so nothing but Batman does consistently super well for them. \n\nPeople aren't necessarily tired of superhero films they are tired of poorly written, poorly directed, low stake, copy paste design superhero movies that lack the substance the earlier films had. Deadpool and Wolverine proves that people will still show up if the movie is good enough.",

I haven't read it, but the book, The Hoods, gives more details on the Combination from what I hear.\n\n  \nFor the first question, it was left ambiguous. The movie is always dipping into the surreal, and one interpretation of the movie is that it's an opium dream of Noodles' when he goes to den in the early part of the movie, after everyone is killed. From the surreal standpoint, look at the dump truck. It has the number 35 at the back, which is also the number of years that Noodles has been in hiding. It would represent the years that he's been stuck in the past, holding onto mistaken feelings of friendship with Max, who he thought died all that time ago. All of that is now out with the garbage. There is also a white bird on the truck, which might be a dove, and would represent the peace Noodles now feels. \n\nThe dump truck then becomes a car full of youth celebrating. In his old age, after all of the excitement, drama, and sadness Noodles has felt, it is now time for his story to end and for the next generation to take up the mantle.\n\n  \nAlso, when Noodles stops and turns around to look at the truck, he's standing in front of what looks like a Chinese pagoda, which might also give support to the opium dream theory.",

So that rejection makes max kill himself or he was murdered when he walked behind the trash truck which was sent to kill him. He was going to kill himself or have noodles kill him. The syndicate did it for him.\u00a0\n\n\nThe hit men in the beginning were looking for noodles because they knew the transaction had been leaked by one of the 4 of them but it was actually max that leaked the info and noodles had to escape. We never see noodles informing the police. It is implied, but max was one step ahead of him and had already leaked the sale info since he knew he was going to fake his death to go into politics and kill the other 3 but noodles slipped away. This detail is murky but that is my conclusion.\n\n\nI do wish they had shown the whole doublecross with the syndicate since it is all vague. We know 2 were killed and max was burned beyond recognition but it was not max. So how did he make the switch?? Who was the body?\n\n\nThere is an argument it is all fragmented because noodles is high on opium and imagining everything in his dream and actually none of it happened. He loves the actress and all he wants is to dream of that world where they are together.",

They would seize the insurance payments as \"recompense\" for the riot the Jewish shopkeepers had suffered in a horrific act of victim blaming and generally engage in a state-sanctioned campaign of robbery and extortion.",

The comic was much more tragic but the reveal of his identity was really great and a good twist, whereas in the movie he just is who we see.\n\nEverything else, though, everything else... way better in the movie than the comic. Same with the sequel (and almost all of Kingsmen, too, actually).\n\nEdit: wait, I just remembered something else I wish the had kept from the comic: the running gag about \"tunk\". Basically, a character keeps trying to make his own made up swear word \"a thing\" (like \"fetch\" from Mean Girls) but it's done very much as a throwaway background gag. But it pays off right at the end when the villain screams it unprompted, showing that somehow, \"tunk\" DID happen!",

Confidential. Its also Nior, but more recent in terms of when it was made.. and kinda has more modern approach. a quicker pace, tho it has a longer run time.",

Put those two together and you get a film with some more of that old-timey theatrical style to the performances, and you just may not dig it.\n\nAs for the plot not seeming unique or the politics not seeming deep, some of that is part of the noir genre, which does lean into tropes pretty heavily. Another part would likely be that many films since then have taken cues from Chinatown.",

How does Guinness World Records decide what gets to be a record and what doesn\u2019t? \n2. How do you avoid creating records that are overly hyperspecific?\n3. Within the community of researchers or people who otherwise work with the Records, is there a drive to be more expansive and create more records, or is it the opposite, for example to curate records better and focus on what readers may find interesting?\n\nThanks for taking the time to answer questions!",

        "comment_body": "> It's a very focused and well constructed movie,\n\nTo be honest, that's kinda my beef with Enemy -- the metaphor is extremely clean and clear imo, it actually leaves little room for expansion and interpretation. The spider represents dark desires and compulsions, the two Jake Gyllenhaals are the two sides of the protagonist (the professor is the real guy, the macho actor is the dude who cheats on his wife and explores his darker masculine compulsions), and the spider at the end is the nagging desires that remain even after he put that part of himself in the past to start a family.\n\nIt's not literal or clearly constructed narratively, but thematically it's very literal and simplistic, in a way that (imo) scrubs detail and specificity out of the story without expanding it thematically.\n\n> and it seems to represent to me, this influence of ugliness and stagnant-ness\n\nI agree, but I really don't think Enemy shoots Toronto with any sort of specifity or attention to detail to accentuate this. As a contrast to Possession, another (and probably the greatest) surreal relationship horror movie, look at how distinct and ever-present the architecture of Berlin is in that film -- it is a story that takes place right on the Berlin wall with the separation of Germany looming over everything, and can't be mistaken for anywhere else.",

We are all different and perceive art in our own unique way.\n\n  \nYou might draw a plain red painting because you just like the colour red. And it might make me feel fear and anxiety because my childhood pet was hit by a red car. And you yourself might like the colour red because it is the colour of one of the first toys you parents ever got you that you do not even remember any more but created that preference for the colour red. Obviously this example is silly and naive but you get what I mean.\n\n  \nThat's the fun of it. We all perceive the world through our own experiences so The Shining might be interpreted differently by different people. And even Kubrick himself is meant to be affected by his own experiences consciously but also subconsciously.\n\n  \nAnd none of the \"theories\" have to be \"true\", that's not the point of them. It is just good fun discussing how we all view art and how it affects us or how we interpret it.",

Cosmo and Wanda are just metaphors for anti-depressants!  \n  \n- Every character in Winnie the Pooh represents a mental disorder!  \n  \n- Rugrats is just the delusional hallucinations of Angelica after she was the only surviving child!  \n  \n- The entire Harry Potter story is just made up by Harry to cope with the Dursley's abuse!  \n  \n- Garfield is hallucinating everything that happens as he starves to death!  \n  \n- Dr Claw is the real Inspector Gadget, disfigured and driven insane by a near-death experience, and the Gadget chasing him is a robotic replacement built by the traumatized Penny!  \n  \nHonestly, the only theory from that period that I actually like is the idea that Bikini Bottom in SpongeBob is actually near the Bikini Atoll and the sea creatures there are mutated to be sapient due to radiation from the nuclear tests.",

Treat it like a bottle film and keep it ultra minimalist, like the album, and you have something that's maybe more on the Love and Mercy side of biopics rather than the Bohemian Rhapsody side of biopics.\n\nBut there's no way that's gonna happen. \n\nAnd you bet your mortgage on the final twist of the movie being that while Bruce recorded all these dark, depressing, no-commercial appeal demos, he also recorded the demo that would become Born in the USA. Maybe they'll be smart enough to connect that Born in the USA is one of those ultra dark, depressing songs and isn't out of place from Johnny 99, Atlantic City or State Trooper.  But I doubt it.",

I'm 19, and I lost my dad when I was 5, but for those first 5 years which are still so vivid in my mind and heart, he was my everything and beyond! It sickens me, how I have next to never seen single fathers raising sons, giving them the love and nurturing affection so many people think only a mother can give. Its bullshit! As a 16 year old, I started having baby fever, which is so not something a boy or young man has ever been depicted of having or feeling in any type of movie or story, real or fiction, and it makes me feel so lonely in having a desire to be a future dad, and bad for other boys who have grown up in need of that father figure in their life, and TRUST ME, every single child NEEDS a father figure, I'd argue more than a mother figure. The statistics for single moms say it all, and me and my brother were one of those very high numbers of children who got messed up by a single mother who failed to prepare us for adulthood in ways that single fathers tend to not. Media severely dictates ways of being to a society, every story, they can make us see things differently and help change and evolve us, that is what stories are here for, so don't deny that these depictions of positive single mothers and deadbeat dads have an affect on growing kids. I think  Mrs Doubtfire is the one of the only few mainstream movies that have ever depicted a dad who displays the nurturing and affectionate qualities always being depicted by a mother, like when he yells out \"you're my goddamn kids too\" or at the end when he is just so broken by having the lights of his existence taken away from him. Another GREAT piece of media that displays this is The TV show version of The Courtship of Eddie's Father, which every parent should be required to see at least the first season. Society needs to wake up, and encourage young boys and men to love fatherhood and parenting. To be the nurturer and provider, not just the mothers. Fathers teaching them how to succeed at life's many curve-ball trials and it's beautiful, deeper meanings. I can\u2019t wait to have babies. I wish I didn\u2019t feel so alone in feeling that way. Society says that only mothers can long for a baby or be the loving one. Men can display BOTH qualities of wanting to be a strong force for their child, being there to prepare them for the tough scrapes and trials of life, while ALSO wanting to sing lullabies and rock their child to sleep, hug and kiss them, be nurturing and emotionally aware. Only mothers are seen as depicting the latter, which is GROSS and needs to change!",

As we walked in they were being removed from those seats by the people actually sitting there, \u201coh so sorry we must have sat in the wrong ones.\u201d Which of course ended with them choosing our seats, and them having to deal with the same thing.\n\nEventually the found seats that presumably weren\u2019t taken by anyone, but the thing is, they were loud and just wouldn\u2019t shut up at all - all the giggling and laughing and telling each other to be quiet, thankfully this all took place during the trailers, but pissed off someone enough to rat them out.\n\nThey swore up and down that they had tickets and their mom let them come and dropped them off to which they were still ushered out because, \u201cyour parent needs to be present during the R rated film.\u201d\n\nThe thing is. . .when I was sneaking into films as a kid I knew to shut the fuck I\u2019m, sit down, and make myself as inconspicuous as possible - they never got the memo.",

I am about to rewatch Don\u2019t move because I vaguely remember or think I remember seeing the same tattoo on Cooper/Richard in Don\u2019t Move. I also remember the all A\u2019s and one B report card when he talks to his daughter and wife on the phone In Don\u2019t Move. I also think there is a scene maybe the same one with the phone call where Cooper/Richard is talking to his wife on the phone in Don\u2019t Move where his real name is stated, Cooper!/Richard (!?), \u00a0In Don\u2019t move he first states his name is Richard. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this in two separate movies, I am no movie buff though, I just enjoy GOOD movies, which are rare these days! MAJOR EASTER EGG FROM SHYAMALAN and the other writer or writers from Don\u2019t Move IF SO!!!!

        "comment_body": "I don\u2019t know that Indy 5 is a great example. \n\nBut on TV there has been this trend toward dark lighting. Star Trek Picard season 3 was a bad offender. \n\nSome of it is because most everything is shot digitally and digital cameras are the opposite of film. With film, film eats light. You almost can\u2019t have enough light. So when things were shot on film you needed a lot of light (until recently) to expose anything. Night scenes traditionally required huge setups and everything you want to expose correctly probably needed a light on it. That\u2019s one of the things that gives movies their look traditionally. Everything is lit even if it doesn\u2019t look lit. Nowadays film stocks are pretty fast and a modern movie or show shot on film like Succession doesn\u2019t necessarily have that lit look. \n\nWith digital it\u2019s the opposite. Digital cameras can basically see in the dark and don\u2019t perform well with lots of light. With film that white point is somewhat elusive but on digital it\u2019s a hard stop and once you hit it you just get noise. So the tendency with digital a lot of times is favor the darker side of things and adjust later if necessary. There\u2019s also the economics that because digital requires less light you don\u2019t need so much lighting gear anymore. You can shoot with a lot less or even natural light and just let things fall off naturally or go dark. Economically you may not get as much time to light either because producers know you can let more slide with digital cameras or adjust in post during the grading session. \n\nBut another factor is just aesthetic. Today\u2019s DPs are very influenced by people like Gordon Willis and Chiaroscuro style lighting is basically the defacto way of lighting. Everyone seems to want that David Fincher look where faces are under exposed. Previously faces all tended to be exposed correctly and backgrounds were typically held to a couple of stops above or below the key light. That\u2019s sort of gone out the window especially on TV. Less so in movies. The movies you list are dark but not obnoxiously so. Grieg Fraser\u2019s work on The Batman is pretty good and if you watch his other films like Dune and Rogue One those movies aren\u2019t dark and he knows what he\u2019s doing. The Batman is more of an aesthetic choice to dirty up the image and make things deliberately imperfect and that extends even into using old Russian lenses with aberrations and running the entire movie, shot digitally, through film to add grain and texture. \n\nWith Indy 5, again Phedon Papamichael is an older school DP who has been around a while and whose other movies like Ford vs Ferrari look normal. Generally I\u2019d classify it as being a bit glossier and glamorous than its predecessors, especially the first three shot by Slocombe which have an almost dirty feel, but not an especially dark movie. \n\nDarkness is also relative. The first Alien movie is very dark but because faces are exposed correctly you don\u2019t really feel it. A lot of old Noir movies are quite moody too where there\u2019s very high contrast but again the faces are legible. What makes something feel too dark is when you can\u2019t really make out faces like Picard season 3. And this is much more about what is stylistically in fashion than anything else. Because technology allows people to go super dark nowadays and you don\u2019t have the kind of QC controls at studios and TV that you used to have where the studio would just make you reshoot something (Deep Space Nine was famously too dark and Paramount made them lighten things up back in the 90s) there\u2019s this arms race to see how dark people can make things. It\u2019s a combination of aesthetics du jour and technology.",

In short, Begins often seems to be compartmentalized from the other two films. In addition, Begins\u2019s photography is less accurate, with a duller color palette and less subtle lighting. Yellow is not a good color imo, the Michael Man\u2019s vibe in TDK is much better. \n\nEditing and pacing are much more mastered in TDK, Begins felt like the first season of a TV show crammed into a 2hr film, with weird time-jumps throughout and sloppy, breakneck editing in most every scene. TDK is still a very fast paced film, but it allows for a few quiet moments that the previous film didn\u2019t have.\n\nExample: after Rachel\u2019s death, there is brief moment of calmness where the audience gets to take in what had just happened (the iconic shot of Batman standing on the burning debris). While its not a very long moment when compared to other films, it is a decent moment to breath relative to the pace of the entire film.\n\nI don\u2019t like Begins, The comic atmosphere was not compatible with Nolan\u2019s vision for me. The other two films are much more mastered.",

What has changed a bit is how things are lit and the move away from photochemical finishing to digital grading which has created a different look in the last 20 years. But a lot of movies from 20+ years ago have a very contemporary feel. Titanic comes to mind. Independence Day. Gladiator. Minority Report. Armageddon. The Matrix. Fight Club. Often the only giveaway is the age of the actors (sometimes), hairstyles and the technology being used especially if there\u2019s not a lot of CG. \n\nThe later seasons of the Star Trek TNG remaster look like they could\u2019ve been shot recently too. That show holds up well despite being 30 years old. \n\n2001 of course looks amazing as does Lawrence of Arabia (65mm is fantastic).

And a lot of the characters in the labyrinth match stuffed toys and dolls she has in her bedroom. There\u2019s a picture on the wall of her mother and what looks like a version of David Bowie. And then the goblin king jareth is David Bowie too.\n\nSo she enmeshes her real world into her fantasy one and the puberty themes are part of the psychology of what she\u2019s going through. It\u2019s time to put down the toys and take responsibility. To become an adult. So she goes on the labyrinth journey as the journey through her innocence and into adulthood.\n\nJareth definitely represents the sexual dangerous male and attraction. That sort of intimidation of discovering a new sexual world like puberty and all the feelings that entails.\n\nNow that\u2019s how I read it and how a lot of breakdowns of it including the production itself sees it.\n\nAnd I remember watching labyrinth for the first time with a friend and I remember being disturbed by David Bowie as jareth and being disturbed as in he was like a monster of horror for me. And I have childhood trauma revolving around sexual things. So even it pinged for me as a young person that there was a sexual presence to the jareth character and story. And was why I felt scared. He felt like a scary sexual presence even if I didn\u2019t quite understand at the time exactly what I was feeling. But that was my personal experience being introduced to the movie. \n\nBut yeah supposedly one giant allegory for puberty was the movie.\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

        "comment_body": "1) The fantasy world may have been based on the book she was reading, but ultimately it's also Sarah's dream world - she's making a fantasy story herself and is the author. Hence, how she realises Jareth isn't in control - she is. Remember, Jareth is a Fae - a being of Fantasy, so he has to follow the rules of narrative casuality.\n\nIt's also heavily shaped by The Wizard Of Oz, Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella and The Little Mermaid (books on Sarah's shelf), albeit as inversions of those stories.\n\n2) I like to think that despite this fantasy theming suggesting otherwise, yes - Sarah *did* go into another world and her friends came back with her into the real world when she's partying in the end. And it may not be considered canon, but the manga sequel shows that yes, the Labyrinth was indeed real - and the goblins are *still* haunting Sarah and Toby even when the boy is now a teenager.\n\n3) This is a... weird answer. But it's basically a sort-of inversion of Beauty and the Beast where Sarah is attracted to Jareth but comes to realise that he's no good for her, kind of like a teenager having a crush on the local bad boy. Also, according to the novel (and based on a clue in the film), Jareth is actually based on an actor Sarah's biologial mother is dating... the parent that Sarah *wishes* to live with instead of her father and stepmother.\n\n4) I already answered this, but Sarah can summon her friends into the real world - kind of based on the idea that while we can grow up, we can also hold onto our innocence and youthful fun and beliefs.",

This innovation passed the Hays Code and influenced subsequent films.\n\nIn fact, bullets do not propel the victim\u2019s body violently backwards. The actual momentum transferred from the bullet to the victim is virtually zero. \n\nIn addition, actor Alan Ladd, who played the hero Shane, was uncomfortable with guns.

Cause realistically if they wanted more saturation than came out in the renders, that could have been pumped up in the DI almost certainly without the image falling apart.",

This is often a sign of using a body double. The same thing happens the other way around where Ray Stevenson or whoever is talking and you only see the back of Beckinsale's character's head. It is very obvious because the movie keeps cutting between two close-ups.\n\n\nThere is at least one scene where you can tell two shots are spliced together to make it appear Beckinsale is in the same shot as the other actor, but every physical exchange between the two (hand-over of an item) is done in a close-up of their hands and any actual dialogue is shot in the way described above.\n\n\nIf you then add that a lot of the action scenes feature obvious stunt doubles and a lot of scenes of her walking anywhere have her face away from the camera and I am willing to bet most of the time you are literally not watching her but a stand-in instead.",

I just rewatched the Suspiria remake and talk about a tall order, an absolutely beloved classic with a super specific style and he in turn went a completely different direction stylistically, built on the themes in interesting ways, and delivered something bold that a lot of people agree is at least on par with the original.

Not even something like Salvation works because the war never happens. This is why every attempt at making a sequel has failed - because they have to retcon T2 and somehow hand-wave away why Judgment Day still happens.\n\nI wish Hollywood would leave this franchise alone and let us bask in the glory of T1 and T2.

Going to one of these specialty Fathom events screenings the article mentions at my local indie theater, the attendance is frequently single digits. I went to see Porco Rosso--there were maybe four other people. I went to see Stop Making Sense--I was the only person there. In fact, I am not sure how the indie theater I go to survives financially--I have never seen the place packed.

Yes, of course, looking at it from today's perspective, the image of the black population is very alienating, but on the other hand, I don't look at medieval literature, for example, and think to myself: yeah, no, the image of women is not very modern here.\n\nAfter all, it's not one-sided: the fact that black people now have rights is also shown as a positive achievement. The tributes that Rhett Butler pays to Mammy also point away from the dream of the South and towards a new reality that has to be lived anew every day. What's really embarrassing is Prissy, but even that I wouldn't want to reduce to the colour of her skin. Fortunately, a character like that would no longer be acceptable *in any ethnic group* these days.\n\nThe music, however, has only been achieved by a few films to date - *Tara's theme* is just the tip of the iceberg here. For me, perhaps the very best scene in an otherwise visually stunning film is actually a short conversation between Melanie and Belle Watling, in which the themes of the two women find a wonderful harmony. And hey, a movie from the 1930s with an image of women that is somehow quite acceptable by today's standards? Even films from the 90s don't always manage that.",

        "comment_body": "I would say the lack of a clear cut charismatic leader makes it quite different from your average cult and therefore harder to pin an exact villain. murdering the other visitors is part of the ritual that they carry out, seemingly to me with the plan of introducing at least one new person to the cult - I think pelle had hoped dani would end up joining mainly because she fit their aesthetic as it is afaik also a white supremacist cult although that is fed in subtler ways. they are very insular which isn't entirely uncommon for cults, they don't all want to recruit as many as possible a la Mormonism so I think they try and bring more people in slowly over time to avoid the effects of incest becoming too dire (while also keeping the gene pool 'pure' aka white), which is also why they lured Christian in to being with that woman (he was raped by my definition but i know other people disagree). I think they want Dani to be in the cult and so they are bent on that from the beginning, that is the motivation and why they go to such pains to give her what she doesn't get from anyone else, let her have some fun moments while still making her somewhat complicit. I personally think they would have killed the others anyway especially - the non white ones - because they had a ritual to carry out and needed a certain number of people and it's better to do it to mainly strangers than entirely members of the cult who are still 'useful' and haven't aged out. I think they send their college aged kids out on pilgrimages to find people and bring them back as either potential victims for their ritual or for integration to add some depth back into the gene pool. in terms of them being missing I would say that's fair to point out and probably at some point there will be issues but it also seems like they're somewhere super remote that you wouldn't easily find and the cult is closed off to outsiders generally, who knows how much the victims told people about where they're going beyond 'im going to Sweden to visit this super weird commune thing' and possibly they cherry pick people with little to no outside connections (Dani is a clear example although we don't know about the others). I think it would be a big risk to invite locals because that would be very noticeable and they would probably have an idea to look there or they may have heard of them and know better rather than tourists who would be excited to see this weird af group of people. what they do in the movie and what happens in a lot of cults is to (sort of) gradually involve them in weirder and more fucked up things but maintaining the shield of this all just being part of their culture and that insulting or interfering with that is therefore a great offence, they're also traumatising them immensely and making them sort of complicit in the horrible acts (since they didn't stop them) which makes it even harder to leave because how do you live with that or even begin to explain it to other people - thus creating a trauma bond that makes people stay with them. also I think all the members of the cult are sincerely devoted to it, that's why they're there - that doesn't make anything okay or mean they aren't also manipulating ppl like Dani. they're all doing it to further the aims of the cult they are part of. they aren't all rubbing their hands together like oh yes time to murder some grad students, this is all a part of their culture which is ultimately fucked up beyond reason and it's still malicious to plan to kill people",

Or confirmation bias, you're remembering more of the criticism than the speculation/excitement.  I don't remember much on Reddit apart from the bland \"first official poster\" and \"trailer #2\" posts which, frankly, is more worrying - there's no such thing as bad ink after all.\n\n>Huge Musical IPs do extremly well at box office with Cats being the only notable exception.\n\nI don't think so - I'm not an expert but my layman's take on IP musicals is recently they've tanked more than not.\n\nEdit: forgot West Side Story\nBudget $100,000,000 (estimated)\nGross worldwide $76,016,171\n\nDear Evan Hansen\nBudget $28,000,000 (estimated)\nGross worldwide $19,133,454\n\nIn The Heights\nBudget $55,000,000 (estimated)\nGross worldwide $45,175,167\n\nCats\nBudget $95,000,000 (estimated)\nGross worldwide $75,558,925\n\nThe Greatest Showman (does it count? Was it an original musical movie?)\nBudget $84,000,000 (estimated)\nGross worldwide $469,064,959\n\nLes Mis (201)\nBudget $61,000,000 (estimated)\nGross worldwide $442,757,529\n\nMamma Mia \nBudget $52,000,000 (estimated)\nGross worldwide $611,452,132\n\nSweeney Todd\nBudget $50,000,000 (estimated)\nGross worldwide $153,384,272\n\nIn fact, mathematically, they should have cast Hugh Jackman.  Like Moneyball for musicals.\n\n>There is a shit ton of buzz on Tiktok.\nNot a useful metric, though I am a *male Redditor*, <shock horror>.\n\n>Cats had nowhere near the current presales and hype for Wicked.\n\nCats had Taylor Swift and about 20% of SAG-AFTRA and Equity, but it still shit the bed.\n\nUntil recently I think many people didn't know who Cynthia Erivo was (I thought she was very good in Widows and El Royale, but I don't think she's a guaranteed nine-figures at the box office on her own).  If Wicked has a $145M budget it will need to land hard to succeed in Hollywood accounting terms.\n\nI don't have a dog in the fight - haven't seen Wicked (my wife despised it) but I don't personally benefit from movies bombing.  I imagine having Ariana Grande in attracts a demographic who will try to drag it down by any means.  I enjoy a good musical - but nothing about the trailer piqued my interest.",

Incredibly frustrating, I've been doing a lot of first time horror watches this season and Prime has really disappointed me multiple times  \n1-Wanted to watch an old one, Carnival of Souls. But Primes only version is color corrected, not the movies original black and white  \n2-I went to rent the original Nosferatu on prime, and their version had text that was clearly a much later and Americanized version (simpler statements, \"Nosferatu\" is exclusively renamed \"Dracula,\" etc)  \n3-Now this, without any indication their streaming a cut version of Suspiria 1977 without even a footnote.

Usually it's for movies where the strength lies more in the performances and script, with the directing being good/very good but maybe not *great*.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes there are very good/excellent directors who are even better at screenwriting.

The most fascist governments of our history have opted for \u201csensitive\u201d systems, while liberal democracies that prioritize the rights of the accused are very much \u201cspecific\u201d systems.\n\nMinority report is all about that. As we falsely rely on an information asymmetry that favors the government, we open ourselves up to more situations where the innocent are punished. Technology, analytics and spyware become justifications for throwing innocent people in jail. Limiting the power of this information is one such way to keep the states power in check.\n\nI think leaning in to the predestination versus free will argument is exactly what the fascist dystopia wants you to think, that there is a legitimate way to prove someone undesirable is destined to be a criminal, even though we see in the movie that that kind of mindset is inherently toxic. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you are pretty sure someone is \u201cdestined\u201d to be a criminal.
