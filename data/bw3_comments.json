I think it\u2019s a gloriously awful movie that equates Christmas with toys and consumerism and at no point does it even attempt to be about anything bigger. It\u2019s cynical and at times even mean. Lithgow said it best decades later: \u201cIt\u2019s one of the tackiest movies I\u2019ve ever been in.\u201d But I have so many fond memories watching it. Lithgow is hammy as hell but wonderfully villainous. David Huddleston made a great Santa. And never in my life has a Coke and McDonalds looked so delicious. And even though the movie is dated as ever, there is something magical about some of the sets and all the practical effects in the toy workshop. Even those puppet reindeer are pretty amazing; I was an adult when I realized they weren\u2019t real reindeer. \n\nSo, yes, this is a bad movie, but one I have nostalgic fondness for in December.",

Actor thinks about it while rehearsing for several days, talks to the director about a tweak.  Director likes it.  two actors rehearse it.  Director approves it.  On the day, two actors perform the scene a bit differently than was in the script, and a change that involved multiple meetings over the course of a week gets called \"improv\" is pretty common.\n\nIn some comedy films they just leave a camera running for an hour while people riff to get a minute of funny stuff.  But that's a very specific style that frankly seldom works well.  The exception is apparently the film The Fugitive.

But also, movies got less interesting and less varied because the conglomerates that own studios now are only willing to fund lowest common denominator projects that might be able to do business around the globe. You could argue better TV was another reason Hollywood went in this direction, because they could offer big-screen spectacle better than TV can, so there is that. \n\nBut now the same forces of slopification that have made movies worse have come to the small screen in the David Zazlav era. Every big content distributor were convinced by Big Tech they needed to hop on the streaming bandwagon, which is an unprofitable venture for almost all of them, so they\u2019ve blown up the workable traditional models of ad-supported broadcast and pay cable that gave us the Golden Age of TV in favor of brand extension sequelitis and limited series that seem like they\u2019re written by an algorithm. \n\nI have to think it will eventually get better, but not before this iteration of the industry collapses under its own bloat. Or maybe it doesn\u2019t get better, who knows",

For some people watching this film today, the mix of characters with different backgrounds and social standings in their school probably didn't stand out to them. In 1985, it was a accurate portrayal where the people in the film likely by default and preconceived notions wouldn't like each other and maybe even were cruel to one another and their coming together actually meant something.",

When you're portraying an awkward teenager though it's kind of an advantage.\n\nHall and Nelson though nailed it. Knew so many kids just like them. The John Bender's I knew in HS  though were actually a lot more cynical and never got near the prom queen.

Here's what I wrote about it at the time.\n\nBeau is Afraid (2023) is the best depiction of the inner mental torment of anxiety, loneliness, and the often brutal nature of life in America (both social and material) that I have seen on screen in a long time. Nobody cares about your suffering. The world is a chaotic and violent place, and the violence is incomprehensible and indiscriminate in its application. Confusion and disorientation are the only things that are lasting and constant. You will have very basic goals and desires that will remain permanently out of reach, often held there intentionally by malicious actors who wish to see you fail to achieve even a semblance of stability. The moment you think that your suffering has ended, the rug will be pulled out from under you, and you will be thrown back into a sea of chaos and loss. \n\nYou will be blamed personally for events that are not only very obviously beyond your control, but which are clearly someone else's fault. This may or may not be known to your accusers, but the outcome is the same in any case. You will lose those you love and be afforded no opportunity to grieve or mourn, and you will feel guilty about it. You will attempt to communicate the deep sense of sadness, loss, emptiness, and betryal that you feel, but manage only to eke out a meek \"what?''\n\nYou will pour your heart and soul into your work, which will not only never be appreciated, but will also be dismissed as unimportant and inadequate by those who profit enormously from it. It will feel very sincerely like the world is engaged in a giant multi-pronged conspiracy against you and only you, but proof of such will slip through your fingers like sand then intentionally scattered in the wind by powerful forces beyond your imagination or capacity to understand. Even still, proof wouldn't matter because nobody cares anyway.\n\nA pervading sense of malice will fill the air and make moving through the world feel like drowning in quicksand; you will at the same moment watch others move so easily that every step appears acrobatic. You will be set up; made to feel safe to confess your true desires, and then made to feel guilty for having them. When you tell your own story you will be accused of lying. Though it feels as if your darkest secrets are always on public display, every private moment of embarrassment broadcast to an impossibly wide audience, you will nevertheless live your entire life without ever being genuinely understood once. You will never truly be seen. You will question whether anyone ever really loved you. You will think often of what might have been but never was. Your death will have been preventable. You will never get a chance to f\\*\\*k Parker Posey, but even if you do your mom still won't be proud of you. Great movie! 10/10.",

So it wasn't pointless to me, just didn't like the point it made.   \n\nFor me Beau is Afraid is the waking nightmare of an anxious person. It's like someone opened that person's head and turned all the anxiety settings to the maximum. Not just that, in this reality all of the protagonist's anxious thoughts seem to come true. This became very apparent early on, because Beau's fears are very valid and sometimes even mundane, probably even mirrored by many viewers themselves in every day life. But the moment the fears become reality, it doesn't feel real anymore, more like a fever dream. And the rest of the movie just keeps escalating this with the same formula.   \n\nThere are certain points, where you can sense some deeper meaning and try to make sense out of things. But maybe you're just better off not to. I would say this is like the movie version of a haunted house ride, with the theme being anxiety.",

It\u2019s refreshing.\n\nI will say I found the story a bit too convoluted and it completely lost me by the end as I just didn\u2019t care emotionally for either of the two main characters. Felt like it went on half an hour too long, and I realise structurally why it did that, but I didn\u2019t ultimately find it satisfying.\n\nOnly seen it once though, and really glad I did to see it on the big screen and how PCW directs the hell out of it.",

You can be so much more than him -- I can show you how.\" Olivia was an outsider to the world of illusions, but had a good eye for stagecraft and learned a lot from her time with Angier. \n\nSo the impact of the moment Angier falls below the stage and Root (as Angier) gets lowered over the stage as Borden makes a dramatic impression on Angier's own stage is twofold -- not only did Olivia help Borden find Root (which he probably could have managed on his own), she also prepared him to make a splash on his rival's own stage and turn one more prank in the back-and-forth war of ruining each other into a huge momentum shift in the rivalry.",

I never heard of him, but I recognized him on the website as the night before I watched the movie Fire Down Below which he was in. Just weird timing that the next day I stumbled upon his website.  I wrote him an email about this experience and he replied.  We went back and forth a few times.  He was down to earth and came across as someone I knew my whole life.  I never forgot that and I never will.  A few years went by and he was of course in Ocean's Eleven.  That was cool to see that things seemed to be going great for him.  I'm saddened to hear that his life has come to an end. What a very cool and very large human being. Rest in peace Scott!",

The film, which shows the positive impact that the real-life Rehabilitation Through the Arts program has on a group of incarcerated men, was also honored with the organization\u2019s Social Justice Tribute.\n\n> \u201cSing Sing\u201d will re-open on Jan. 17 exclusively in theaters, though a final count of screens hasn\u2019t been finalized. A24 released the picture on July 12. However, despite the months that have passed since its debut, the indie studio refrained from releasing it digitally or on other streaming platforms.

Ethan Hawke, Willem Defoe, Sam Neil. Not some all-time great genre flick, but the insane premise was pursued with gusto, and the actors gave their all. The result is a fucking fun and under-discussed vampire flick.\n\nI\u2019m hoping for a similar result here. Plus, when\u2019s the last time a werewolf movie was made?

I'm not so sure I see it quite the same as you. \n\nI think there's actually a good dose of Patrick being duped by Helene's reactions, which to me came across as somewhat calculated   \n\nNow, I believe that Helene was actually upset, I also believe that people like Helene - and I have personal experience - are emotionally performative and manipulative. \n\nI know I'm cynical, but I see Helene as thinking that's how she is supposed to act. Her child is missing, she needs to not only cry,  but she needs to promise to stop drinking, stop using drugs, stop doing crimes. But in reality, she's sad her \"doll\" Amanda is gone, but she'll get over it and then her life will actually be improved. If she truly cared about Amanda being returned, why lie about Cheese, the drugs, the money? Any other person would do anything to save their kid. You don't think Helene thought about when she was going to dig that money up?\n\nOf course, she's genuinely happy to get her daughter back, and it actually turns into an opportunity for fame, money and love - for Helene. Amanda is once again relegated to an afterthought, with the added tragedy that her support network has now been completely eliminated - Lionel is in jail, Bea has gone away and now Helene will have even more reason to be away from the house. \n\nI would say that Patrick did the right thing, for both wrong and right reasons. It's right to return a child to their home and their birth parent(s), but it was wrong to believe that Amanda would be better off with Helene, especially as the family was destroyed. It's likely that Amanda will have a worse life with Helene than she would have with the Doyle 's, so you could say Patrick made a selfish choice because he didn't want to feel guilty. That, and he felt like he was atoning for shooting Corwin Earle. Like he was balancing the scales. Not only was he unable to save  little Johnny right after failing to save Amanda, but he followed it up with the sin of murder, even if others saw it as righteous. \n\nAnyway, just an opinion, I don't claim to be correct!",

I remember when there used to be 3 or 4 big movies opening wide on any given week, and now it seems like there is just not a lot coming out. I think it has to do with the strikes and post-Covid/post-streaming theater decline in general. It does make me sad though, I used to get so excited about going to the movies and now there are so few movies coming out and even fewer that I actually want to spend the money to go see.",

On being selected, Bryld remarked \"There's a sense of a spirit of the '70s movies \u2014 breaking away from your studios. And all the DPs of the period that I really admired would push the film stock or they would do handheld or whatever. And then I started thinking, 'That's really what I should be going for.'\" Both digital and film formats were tested prior to filming, before it was decided to shoot the film digitally with an [Arri Alexa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arri_Alexa) with [Panavision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panavision) H series lenses, particularly a 55mm lens, creating a \"vintage portrait look.\" \"It's a movie about people who are forced into the frame together, and they don't necessarily want to be in the same frame,\" Bryld added. \"Gradually over time, they come together more and more ... And that was one arc we were looking for \u2014 how we would reflect that, how we framed it and where we put the camera.\" [Film emulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_emulsion) and [color grading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_grading) were added to the footage during post-production to complete the look.\n\ntl;dr: It was shot digitally and made to look like film, which is never going to look exactly like the original period. It probably would have cost too much too shoot on film, or perhaps they didn't want it to look that authentically period.",

Paul Wilson, who wrote the novel off of which the film is based, called it an incoherent monstrosity, but I know a handful of folks that love it.  Personally, I found it to be a slog, but appreciated the work done by Scott Glenn, Ian McKellen and Gabriel Byrne, not to mention the synth laden soundtrack by Tangerine Dream.  It honestly is an engaging premise, but perhaps Michael Mann was too inexperienced at the time to take it on.  The fog machine should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but, such are the limitations of working with a small budget.",

If you're asking how he was there to save her if he hadn't been born yet, it's because Anna time travelling to 1952, then giving birth to Paris had already happened. What happens is that she essentially time travels from 2022 to 1952, before she was born. Since she time travels to a period before she was born, her past-self would be in 2014 (her birth year). Here's a hypothetical scenario to help explain it better. Imagine Lily (born in 2002) time travels 40 years into the past from 2024. The year is 1984. Then she gets into a relationship with someone, has sex, and then becomes pregnant. She then gives birth to a son in 1985. The son technically exists before his mother Lily was born, who was born in 2002.\n\nThis is essentially what happens in the film. To sum it all up, Anna is born in 2014, time travels to 1952 from 2022, starts living her life from there, gives birth to Paris in 1972, dies in 1999, and then her other self is born in 2014 and will then eventually time travel to 1952 again in 2022. The cycle repeats. They're basically stuck in a time loop, an endless chain of events manipulated by time travel that continue to repeat.\n\n>Like what started the loop?\n\nObviously the time portal within the lake, but there was no \"beginning\" to the loop, if that's what you're asking. The chain of events (i.e. Anna going back in time to '52, giving birth to Paris, then Paris and Celeste having Ellie) is essentially endless. So there was no beginning point. It's a closed loop that continues to repeat. If you think about it, there couldn't have possibly been a \"start\" to the time loop. If there was, the events that unfold in the film couldn't have occurred in the first place. You see, in order for Anna to have time travelled to 1952, Ellie would've needed to exist. In order for Ellie to exist, Paris would've needed to have existed. But Paris couldn't have existed if Anna didn't time travel to 1952, so she would've needed to have time travelled to there in the past already. It must've already happened in order for the same sequence of events to occur again. And in order for the past sequence of events to have occurred, the same sequence of events before that would've needed to have occurred. You get the picture. The chain goes back endlessly. This is called the predestination paradox, where a loop occurs when a person travels back in time and their actions in the past lead to the timeline they came from. This creates an infinite causal loop where cause and effect become intertwined.",

This movie is utter madness. It contains enough plot elements for four or five different movies and cannot decide if it wants to be a rom-com or a farce or both. There's a main plot line where Poppy has stolen her deceased mother's identity to write a book and has to convince her publisher it's for real, another main plot line where she had a one-night stand with the publisher's son under her real identity but now has to pretend to be someone else (and he... doesn't recognise her even though they had sex like weeks ago because she changed her hair) and then some additional plot lines where gay guys have to pretend to be straight and Poppy rents a kid to act as her daughter and there are a whole bunch of other competing plotlines and none of it makes any sense at all, but somehow it was still really watchable.",

It is a paradoxical and confusing situation, which is what Alpha Wayman warned about, but her shifting to the alternate universe is already at the point that Evelyn is breaking the barriers of what can be done normally with jumping. It also helps that the universe at the end is much closer to what her life could have been if there was no multiverse hopping. Also, I don't think she's just active in those two universes, but every universe. \n\nWhich comes to part 2: Evelyn is Evelyn in every universe, and Joy is Joy in every universe. Evelyn apologises to Joy in the IRS universe (with all the fighting and the Everything Bagel in the IRS) which is the base universe for our Evelyn, but in this is apologizing to Joy in all universes, even when there is no life, and only rocks. \n\nIt is often a very emotional based film, and trying to place perfect logic on it all can be tough, but I think if you follow the story of the Evelyn that leaves the IRS, you have a simple grounded story of a woman that has a breakdown but is able to reconcile and recognize the beauty in the life that she lives with her family, everything else around it just being an artistic interpretation of her mental state.",

Jeremy Irons was decent and to be honest, even after the relately recent rewatch I can't remember much about Gabriel Byrne.\n\nAbout Depardieu... yeah, let's say it's the best you didn't even include him on the list.",

While it doesn\u2019t overtly have characters switching sides, it does show the humanization of \u2018enemy\u2019 soldiers and the disillusionment with war.\n\nAnd for a more direct example, *\u2018Schindler\u2019s List\u2019* is a powerful story of Oskar Schindler, a Nazi party member, who risks everything to save Jewish lives during the Holocaust.

What is to be done? The most direct solution would be government intervention. If it wanted to, a presidential administration could enforce existing antitrust law, break up the conglomerates, and begin to pull entertainment companies loose from asset-management firms. It could regulate the use of financial tools, as deWaard has suggested; it could rein in private equity. The government could also increase competition directly by funding more public film and television. It could establish a universal basic income for artists and\u00a0writers.

The streamers know that they need a regular flow of New Stuff for their audiences - if I'm not subscribed to Amazon Prime right now with what they currently have, I'm probably not going to randomly subscribe next month if they don't add anything else.\n\nOf course, it's really hard to know what keeps someone subscribed to a service - you can measure what the first thing new sign-ups watch is as a metric of what got them to sign up, but once people are in the ecosystem how do you know if they would have stayed subscribed with or without some new movie?\n\nThat's why they track a lot of other metrics. How many people watch the movie the day it comes out? The week it comes out? Do people watch it more than once? Do people who watch the first five minutes keep watching? Six months from now are people still watching it or is it forgotten? None of these can explicitly tell you how much money a movie made for your streamer, but they're all metrics you can use to measure against other movies that you're making.",

Against the Jotunn, he realizes it isn't the same scenario and that it is better to attempt to escape, fight, and likely die than to live as a coward. Living while others die is traumatizing but isn't cowardly. Living at others' expense is cowardly.",

I don't know to what you are referring when you say Idina Menzel \"and crew\". What do you mean? Her cameo appearance?   ARE YOU CALLING KRISTEN CHENOWITH MERE \"CREW\"???   \n\nNo matter to what you are referring - you'd be wrong on several counts.  SONGWRITERS not the singers are awarded the Oscar. Even if they were - Idina was the voice for Let It Go which won in 2013.  If any of the Wicked songs were eligible, it would be Stephen Schwartz who would be the nominee as he has written both the music and lyrics, as far as the original musical goes.  It also would not be a first for him - he has two Oscar wins under his belt.   Allegedly there are two new songs for Part 2, and I assume he'll have some part in those songs but that isn't a guarantee.  They may choose to play a song during the credits that is inspired by the musical (heck, both Cynthia and Ariana are song writers.  They may collaborate on something)",

The aesthetic is what draws a lot of people to the genre. The inevitability of it all and the visible representation of decay and things that shouldn't even be able to really move coming after you with no reprieve.\n\nPart of why I wish they'd just do a good World War Z series so they could just separate the stories out into individual episodes.",

It had been awhile for me so I forgot how everything plays out. It was so suspenseful and thrilling throughout the movie.   \n\nThen for no particular reason I watched Dressed to Kill.  I had no idea it was Brian De Palma's homage to Psycho so that was a big surprise.   It's crazy to see how influential Hitchcock was and still is.",

I thought Saulnier did such a masterful job of getting me on this guy\u2019s side and really just wanting the worst for these backwoods shit heels that the concept of having this character have the most adept hand-to-hand combat skills and then couch them for the finale in a pacifist way was both totally unique and absolutely frustrating. I wanted these guys to get wrecked, Saulnier style, and instead got what is perhaps the most tame and clean \u201cviolence\u201d Saulnier has ever put to screen. It\u2019s ironic that his characters who aren\u2019t trained killers actually slash and hack bloodily through his other movies and the most adept killer he\u2019s ever put to sceen doesn\u2019t really want to hurt anyone.

Like the Lord of the Rings movies. You really can't put a four hour film in theaters, it just isn't feasible for a variety of reasons.\n\nOther times, they need to cut specific content to make rating. This was common in the 90s-00s raunchy comedy genre like American Pie, where you'd get an extended \"unrated\" edition that included those scenes they couldn't keep. This is of questionable merit, but there's at least a reasonable justification.\n\nThere's also times where the producer or production studio will insist on changes and cuts against the director's wishes. Maybe the original ending tested badly in prescreenings. A \"director's cut\" that restores the scenes as the director originally intended can make for a very different movie, with the classic example being Blade Runner.",

One of my jobs was to work out walkie communication beforehand in a dense rainforest on the big island of Hawaii, where we were shooting for weeks. It of course was not working and I got production to rent these relay boxes we called base stations that would in theory push the signal of the walkies we all had to relay to the base station above to send supplies, A list actors, prop vehicles, whatever down the built road. It rarely worked. One day in total exasperation from days of  communication failures with these base stations, in his thick British accent I heard him on channel one in front of god and everybody say \n\n\u201cI want to take a knife \nand stab \nthis base station\u201d \n\nI laughed a lot alone in my lockup in the rainforest bc it was def my fault those were there. lol",

Their acting is a big reason why the film works.\n\nAs far as Shyamalan he definitely intentionally wrote the entire film around the twist as it re-contextualizes the entire film and has red herrings like the shot of Toni Collete and Bruce Willis facing each other in the same frame, but never actually interacting or communicating with each other.\n\nI don't think this was a happy accident like Spielberg had with the broken down shark.  Especially considering how often he went to that same well.  I think he is just really enamored with this type of narrative structure.\n\nAlso remember that this came out during the slasher revival of the 90's so it was a breath of fresh air after stuff like \"Scream 2\", \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\", and \"Urban Legend\".\n\nLastly, it's just a solidly made film with a good pace.\n\nShyamalan's influences are clear as day in this picture and I think he did them justice.\n\nSpielberg, and specifically the films \"Jacob's Ladder\" and \"Poltergeist\".  Here's a scene in \"[The Sixth Sense](https://youtu.be/cFR796HdoUk?t=37)\" that's directly lifted from \"[Poltergeist](https://youtu.be/0TpqonU8TN4?t=116)\" for example.",

I think his niche has led to him being unfairly maligned when I don't believe his target audience was ever the people criticizing his work. I think if Baz Luhrman can make stylized movies that appeal to very few audiences then I don't see how Tyler is any different. Also the characters he writes in his movies, especially th female characters, are based on the women that raised him. I knew older black women in the church like Madea.

It's bright, loud, fast. Has a theme about generational trauma, immigrant identity, mental health, lgbt, multiverse, etc. I think that movie will stand.\n\nI agree with you with Into the Spiderverse. I just hope they get their act together and stick the landing with the third film, so the first film dont get too tarnished.\n\nI wanted to say Barbie and Oppenheimer also but I feel like that's more because of the 'Barbenheimer' event and memes, not because of the movies itself.",

        "comment_body": "The basic outline of the film? Sure. The exact same film? I don't think so.\n\nI doubt the method actor character would be in blackface for three reasons:\n\n1. \"method actor\" is now a byword for \"fucking arsehole looking for an excuse to be a dickhead to people\" rather than \"extreme body transformation\" so the blackface joke *no longer satirises anything people are doing*\n2. streamers remove historical uses of blackface from television show back catalogues nowadays -- it's way more fraught appearing in blackface in 2024 than it was in 2008 and certainly more so than 1994\n3. if a film *did* make a joke about an actor so method they get skin colour changing surgery in a movie satirising modern Hollywood, it would be about a black woman being cast to play a redhead... *maybe* a light skinned black actor darkening their skin or even just playing a darker skinned character\n\nObviously this would require losing the [\"what do *you* mean ' you people'?\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPxs0Qh72kY) bit.\n\nI similarly doubt the \"never go full retard\" joke would be included:\n\n1. again, the word is way more contentious now than in 2008 when, frankly, it wasn't contentious at all\n2. as with the black face, the joke no longer makes any sense -- if you're a comedy actor looking to be taken seriously or someone chasing an Oscar, you wouldn't conceive of trying to make a Simple Jack movie... you'd go away and so some prestige TV play or do a biopic\n\nThe TiVo joke would be changed, the rookie director would be some kind of indie darling and I think the adoption plotline would be dropped, too.\n\nActually, what Tropic Thunder is trying to do as a film is so specific I'm not sure it'd even be a war film any more. It'd probably just straight up be a fake biopic about the making of a movie. But that's not really what you're asking.",

        "comment_body": "Movies have a far different production value and pipeline than video games. To you, they're all the same. Games are rendered real time and often have very plain and simple structures for the world environment for the real time rendering.\n\nNot everyone is a gamer so they don't view things the way you do. Which is why you can't fathom why most find it uncanny. And the ones like me who grew up with both, I can still say the movies are crossing Uncanny Valley because I can separate the mediums and give them their due credit for their artistic goal.\n\nMovie productions have more money and time to render more of the world to make it all seem more immersive as far as the narrative goes. The backgrounds and things like the trains and the trees will be much easier to design, render and animate. We can suspend our disbelief on that most of the time.\n\nHuman characters went through a lot over the years in film. Motion capture wasn't that common and much more expensive back then. It was a first for everyone when Polar Express came out. It was the most advanced CG animated film we've seen where they do much more to animate the characters.\n\nAgain, there is no video game reference for most audience viewers. And the ones who do have that reference, we don't see it that way, at all. We have total autonomy in video games. Sure games can have a story, but you're given so much that it's nowhere near the same entertainment, regardless of the same technology.\n\nLet's not even throw in A.I. generated content as none of that was around when these movies came out.\n\nA Christmas Carol is the better one as it's later in time. Technology has advanced, streamlining the process has advanced. Polar Express were the pioneer days.\n\nThe cinematic aesthetic to the movies made it uncanny because they're telling us a story through a deeply cinematic approach.\n\nAgain, games can get cinematic, but back then, none ever looked like a Hollywood movie.\n\nThe process for video games today is more similar to making a movie than it ever was decades ago. And today, a lot of people will still shit on video games and say they did actors dirty. Any game done with Unreal Engine 4 will look shoddy and uncanny because they don't have what it takes to fully animate the mouths properly. The biggest culprits are anything by Supermassive Games. From The Quarry to the whole Dark Pictures Anthology, all the games are done in Unreal Engine 4 and most people laugh at how the characters look when compared to their known actors. David Arquette is much more emotive and expressive with his face than he is in The Quarry. Until Dawn remake is done by another studio that did the game in Unreal Engine 5, which makes it easier. But what gives the most potential is a game using the Metahuman plugin for Unreal Engine 5 games, like Hellblade 2. Mouth animations and lip synching becomes more apparent, which would traverse into uncanny valley (where you wonder if you are looking at a real person in a pre-rendered cutscene or in-engine rendering CG character).\n\nUncanny Valley is a very broad term. From Polar Express to limited range in Unreal Engine 4 to hyper real movement in Unreal Engine 5 and its plugins.\n\nI never would have called any of the older games from the 360 era uncanny valley. They immediately looked like they were limited by their hardware. With the UI, gameplay mechanics, scripted environments you trigger, the immersion makes it different than watching a major motion picture of which you have zero control or influence. I'm pretty sure that's why no one else calls those older games uncanney valley. Sure you have PS1 Hagrid and some Shrek games, but there is a deeply embedded level of expectation that they are going to be ugly as sin because of hardware limitations. Where movies are virtually limitless (compared to consoles), they're going to push boundaries. And they did.",

Tim Burton was courted to direct; when he turned it down, Disney went for his production designer Robert Stromberg. It was a borderline-disastrous shoot, with an additional director brought in for reshoots and a storyline that so radically changed that journalists who attended a set visit were banned from reporting what they saw. The movie nevertheless made almost $800 million worldwide and inspired a sequel years later.",

So it's a real story that can't be copyrighted and nobody is left from the family directly to claim ownership or block these endless exploitation flicks on grounds of taste. On Google Maps the entire street where the original house was is STILL blocked off. I really think this whole franchise is a bit of a mistake and there's no way you could take a horrific event like this from recent years and make a horror franchise from it due to social media backlash.",

But the government basically cracked down on the film industry. Creative control was severely diminished and movies became generic and samey as they all had to adhere to very strict standards as to what they could and could not show.

The soundtrack - which is freakin' amazing - does a lot of heavy lifting, though the visuals and the acting are certainly of equal caliber.  The one place where the movie stumbles a bit is probably the story, and the way it's structured in the film.  I think a lot of people are going to walk away disappointed and unsatisfied with it, but if you're someone who enjoys letting your brain chew on things, digging into the symbolism and picking apart themes, there's a good chance you'll really enjoy it.  I found it to be truly mesmerizing and incredibly haunting.  Not a movie I want to rewatch regularly (not as often as I listen to the soundtrack), but I really don't need to because parts of it have lived rent free in my brain for almost 20 years now.\n\nI don't think it won any awards, but it should have.

She had found herself locked in a bunker with this monster and wanted out. The help is probably a suggestion she has hoped that someone would come rescue her as opposed to doing what our protagonist did and rescue herself.\n\nAs for what truly happened, it's left unsaid and we don't truly know just like the protagonist doesn't truly know. The strong insinuation however is that she was likely murdered and yes probably given an acid bath. This adds even more shine to our protagonists escape, as she defied odds where those before her had failed to do.\n\nBut it's been a while, I may be missing key pieces of info.",

Assuming the 4k disc is properly mastered, it should be much closer to what Tarantino was seeing when piecing the film together on 35mm in the editing bay than any DVD could ever hope to be.\n\nIf I had to guess, he doesn't like the look of films shot digitally on 4k and mastered to have that super clean pristine look. That won't be the case for a 4k transfer of a 35mm film unless the people doing the mastering fuck it up with DNR and other unnessessary processing like those awful Terminator 2 and True Lies remasters.",

But no doubt something will emerge. \n\nI also think the critics were unfair to The Thing.  At worst, it was a great monster movie. But that move is jam packed with talent:  Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Donald Moffet. . .all actors with serious punch and long careers.  It also has my all-time favorite ending to a monster movie.  The SFX at the time were extraordinary (and gross).  It had a great eerie soundtrack from Ennio Morricone.  \n\nI think the critical reception is a big miss - but maybe that's because the film has such a 70's pessimistic vibe and we were now into the go-go optimism of the 80s era.  Like it was released 5 years too late.  \n\nBut that's why the film wears so well, it wasn't another 80s Spielberg feel-gooder.  \n\nCarpenter's previous film was Escape from New York (also with Kurt Russell and an incredible cast) - which is like the last city in decline movie that I can remember also evoking a strong 70s ethos that get's left behind in the 80s.",

Scream is a straight up critique of the Slasher genre that took off with Halloween in the late 70's and got campier and campier with the worst sequels of the Friday the 13th and Nightmare films.",

        "comment_body": "Plenty of artistic films get made in America every year, they're just not financed by large studios.\n\nLarge studios have large costs and therefore need large revenues, which require either a lot of small profitable films or a few big blockbusters. Ever since the advent of home viewing, they cannot depend on theaters being full every weekend to watch smaller films, so they try to pack their audiences in with big expensive movies they'll leave home to see.\n\nHowever, there has never been more of an ability to make artistic films than ever. Whole movies can be filmed on devices, and are. \n\nThe issue is distribution. It costs money to get a movie shown in Kansas, for example, and theater owners know they have limited screens and therefore that real estate is expensive and they prefer it makes money for the theater. Your artist making a small movie can make that movie cheap, but those folks in Kansas will never see it because the filmmaker can't afford to pay for the screens to show it to them.\n\nThere's also the fact that many of the screens in the US are under a few corporations and they already have big studio deals filling up many of their screens years in advance.\n\nLastly, filmmaking in the US is not considered an art form by the Government worth really funding. Many countries have funding they give to artists that help them with making and distributing films. The US doesn't really do that on a scale that allows the mass distribution it would need to get popular, at least not that I know of. \n\nAll that said, if you visit small arthouse theaters all over the nation run by actual film hounds, usually in larger cities, you'll see lots of artistic films that the owner likes and think people need to see. Those films can get popular enough to be shown to film festival boards or film execs, who can feature them and they can get a following, and eventually possibly receive large scale distribution that way. The Blair Witch Project is a famous example I remember off the top of my head.\n\nLastly is the LA hustle- a filmmaker goes to Mecca and shleps their film around Hollywood, trying to get a distribution deal by sheer determination. I am not too privy to how this part works, as I don't work in the industry, but I know that some films reach wide release just because it was shown to the right person and they loved it and showed it to the world.\n\nBut there are plenty of artistic films being made in America every year. They just don't get popular enough to be shown where you are. I can go to my nearby arthouse theater and watch a full day's worth right now. I used to do that some Saturdays when I lived in the city.\n\nAnd if course there's streaming. People can now throw their short artistic films on YouTube or other platforms and have many, many more people see it than would have ever under the studio model. It's yet another way to get a deal and get the big money to make the big movies. Lights Out was a YouTube short that got the filmmaker a feature film career.\n\nIs that the way it should be though? I don't know. The current system allows us to have the spectacle movies we go to the theater to see and those that want to see artistic films can still see them. Would it be helpful to the broader culture to have those folks in Kansas see artistic movies funded by the Government?\n\nEhh...America is weirdly sensitive to controversy, and art is full of it. All it would take is one film funded by the Government that pisses anyone off and there'd be protests and investigations and a lot of drama. There are certain parts of the American electorate that think art in general is not worthy of respect, not less funding, and that kind of thing would become more about the political football situation and less about actually funding artistic filmmaking.\n\nI also would be concerned about our Government in particular having any particular influence over art in general and filmmaking specifically, as when it does it can quickly verge into propaganda or run headfirst into the 1st Amendment, which protects expression from the government. McCarthyism and the blacklists showed us that perhaps the government needs to stay out of the movie business in America.",

        "comment_body": "The answer is money. Blockbuster movies are generally a safer bet than art house movies for making money worldwide, and money makes movies in Hollywood. These days, your average audience member is only going to show up to the theater for spectacle, which a blockbuster movie is more likely to provide. Otherwise, they're  more likely to view the movie on streaming, when they can get it for free. Studios and theaters thus have to appeal to the lowest common denominator by creating something big, flashy and easy to digest. They can't allow as much experimentation as the past simply because their business model doesn't allow it. \n\nThat's not to say that there aren't any studios at all that create art house movies-- a24 has found a way to make popular films cheaply and thus can experiment with more thoughtful big budget films like civil war without breaking the bank.",

Everyone is taking about Demi Moore (and she was great, don\u2019t get me wrong) but if there was only one horror performance that could be recognized this year it should be Naomi Scott.\n\nNormally I would roll my eyes at yet another sequel being made in a horror franchise but judging how good the second one was, I am really hoping we get a third one.

Angier is militant and kills every copy, because he can't abide the idea that he's not the only him. It's the same reason that he was never able to work with the \"double\" version of the trick very well, he could never work with the idea that he's not the one getting the applause.\n\nIn contrast, Borden takes this dichotomy and makes it his life.

Set during the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics, the film follows an American Sports broadcasting team that quickly adapted from sports reporting to live coverage of the Israeli athletes taken hostage. Through this lens, \"September 5\" provides a fresh perspective on the live broadcast seen globally by an estimated one billion people at the time.\n \n>At the heart of the story is Geoff (John Magaro), a young and ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss, the legendary TV executive Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard). Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage. As narratives shift, time ticks away, and conflicting rumors spread, with the hostages' lives hanging in the balance, Geoff grapples with tough decisions while confronting his own moral compass.",

No doubt, dozens of officers have poured over its contents (as alluded to by her father \"I don't know nothin' new to tell ya.

Many US corporations were doing business with the Nazi's and not thrilled to get involved in a other war in Europe....but Japan's decision to attack Pearl Harbor and Hitler declaring war on the US, changed everything. Rick represents the 'neutral' US....but due to circumstances, becomes involved in the war, like it or not. When Rick/USA joins the fight, those being overrun by the Nazi's now had hope that the Allies would prevail. As noted above....nobody knew who would prevail.

Luke Wilson, Craig T Nelson, and Diane Keaton are the real highlights of the film. \n\nOverall I think it's a decent film. I watch it every December.",

There's a few I haven't seen and others I haven't seen in a very long time.  \n\nThe 4K/HDR restoration of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is stunning. The artistry on display in that film holds up so incredibly well. Shots like Snow White's reflection in the wishing well, the forest animals walking over along the tables in the dwarfs' cottage, the rotating shot as the Queen transforms, the dance sequence; they'd all be impressive in modern animated film. Really thinking about how it was all done by hand and how mind-blowing it must have been for audiences hammers home why it's considered one of the best films of all time.  On top of that a lot of the gags still hold up today. I haven't watched it since I was a kid and it's still funny!",

And you have to be willing to accept a little absurdism to like it: most of it's already far less absurd now than it was when the movie came out. The music is great, the pacing is great, it just flies by every time I rewatch it and end up watching all of it all over again.\n\nAgree to disagree, it's my favourite movie ever.",

That out of the way, it felt dated and over the top even in the 90s and this was probably at least partly intentional as Tarantino (as writer) loves his tributes and call backs. Also because the dialogue is so hammy in places and Alabama - the only female character by the way - is more fetished than really developed as a character (\"she even tastes like a peach\" cmon). But there are so many great performances in this movie - apart from the leads, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken etc. prove that whole point about there being no small parts. Val Kilmer as Imaginary Elvis. I can't help but love it.",

When he leaves the mother, he lacks the appropriate support to process his insecurities. The jedi are well-intentioned but much of their teachings are actually counterproductive and  lead him further astray.\n\nOne I personally love because little is explicitly given, but there's plenty of little reactions that hint at a deeper story that you can imagine, but Vincent in Collateral is a fascinating character study.",

It also hurts that they don\u2019t have Lin-Manuel Miranda back for the soundtrack, as the songs he did for the first movie were undeniably earworms. I\u2019ve heard two of the songs from this new one, whatever the first one they released was, and Dwayne Johnson\u2019s solo song which is clearly trying to replicate \u201cYou\u2019re Welcome\u201d and both are\u2026 not great. \n\nMoana 2 is probably still gonna do great, but I don\u2019t see it being anywhere near as successful as the first movie, and likely don\u2019t see it knocking down Wicked\u2019s run either.",

It definitely could have been a lot better both in terms of standard movie making and as an adaption, but I feel it's biggest hinderance is the scope of the story. The movie adapts the first Warcraft game, which was initially a fairly simple premise, war between humans and invading orcs. As the game series went on, the lore was expanded retroactively, affecting the first game by giving it a wider scope.   \n  \nThe film could have kept it somewhat simple, and focus on the human and orc conflict with better fleshed out characters, and the first two games would serve as a decent trilogy of movies. If that went well, then you can explore movies that expand a lot more on the lore, I.E. taking story beats from Warcraft 3 and WoW. Alternatively, and for the better imo, a TV series would be a better route to go with an epic story this big.",

        "comment_body": "I'm not willing to do an interview but here are my thoughts as a random Internet person.\n\nThose who are making an adaptation from anything to anything are walking on a very tight rope. On one hand, they need to pick from a community that's popular enough to have a solid base - people playing that video game (video game series is best) - and you also might need to change parts of the adaptation to explain it to those who don't play that game or even any game of that genre.\n\nLet's look at the top 3 [highest video game adaptations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films_based_on_video_games).\n\nThe first one is obviously The Super Mario Brothers Movie. Although it was adapted previously, [it didn't do very well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._\\(film\\)) even though I bet it'll be more memorable as time goes on. What worked in this movie? Mario didn't sound like an Italian plumber and neither did his brother. Princess Peach and Bowser were played well. Why did it work well? It added a good mix of nostalgia - people who played this game in the 80s/90s and their kids who have been exposed to the modern games. However it was also... animated. So you don't have that odd cringe with a real movie and you have characters looking *exactly* like the videogame many people have played.\n\nThe second one is Pokemon Detective Pikachu. Pokemon is also another massive video game series and Ryan Reynolds can put butts into seats. Also semi-animated where the key bits - the Pokemon - also didn't have that real world cringe.\n\nI want to give the third one to Warcraft but I'd like to give it to the Sonic series instead. Warcraft made money - and it also a hybrid real life/CGI mix - but it simply was made too late when Warcraft's popularity has been fading for years. Small shoutout to Uncharted where everyone wanted Nathan Fillion years ago to make it instead of what we got. Sonic also went the hybrid route and a few things worked there. Key selling point? Good humor with Sonic and the comeraderie with James Marsden. Plus Jim Carrey stole the show in all the movies so far. You can tell the difference considering the related TV show is also doing well.\n\nSo what worked well in all of these?\n\n* Good timing where the video game series selected is currently still popular to continue to produce titles.\n* It apparently has to be CGI or at least CGI enough where any character has to look very close to the actual video game character.\n* Any popular movie like this should appeal to kids which is why the more kid-friendly video games are going to be more popular than, perhaps, a Dark Souls adaptation.\n* Sprinkle in some well-known celebrities and poof, you have a successful adaptation.\n\nI think that as these movies will continue to get released, it's possible that more mature adaptations will be more popular. For instance, I think Ghost of Tsushima would be an amazing movie but the studios have lost their opportunity with Assassin's Creed by releasing it too late.",

        "comment_body": "I'll say this about the 90's Super Mario Bros. movie - it's not good but they had a batshit crazy interpretation of the Mario world and rolled with it. Also, even if neither of them cared for the movie, Hoskins and Leguizamo were pretty good casting for Mario and Luigi.\n\nThe newer movie obviously stuck with the game formula but it was nowhere near the disaster that people anticipated it was going to be. Pratt as Mario was deemed basically a war crime but he did fine IMO. The worse casting ended up being Rogen as Donkey Kong.\n\nThe original Resident Evil movie, even if it is still far from the concept of the game, is actually pretty decent. Most everything after that, not so much. Then the most recent one tried to be more faithful to the story, the director is a huge fan, but somehow messed that up by taking two games and cramming them into one movie (and making Leon a literal idiot).\n\nI think it's pretty clear that television/streaming is a better avenue for video game media than feature films are. You've got Fallout, Last of Us, even Twisted Metal that are able to \"get it\".",

        "comment_body": "Staffing minimums for writers is a big deal.\n\nCurrently, many animation studios have shifted away from having a writer's room, opting instead to hire a single writer and have the entire season written by a revolving door of freelance writers. The freelancer comes in, unfamiliar with the shows lore and characters, and must do unpaid research (reading through pages and pages of character bios, watching older episodes, discussing details).\n\nOnce the freelancer turns in their work, no matter how good of a writer they are, 8/10 times their script is not gonna fit the voice of the show since they haven't spent enough time with the world and characters. So the only hired writer has to basically re-write their episode anyways. It's incredibly taxing for the hired writer, and unfortunate for the freelancer since what they wrote barely makes it to screen. But studios don't care, they're saving a few bucks.\n\nStaffing minimums would lay the groundwork for the contract stating that union studios MUST hire a minimum of 4-5 writers (spitballing numbers here) and can't rely on freelance only rooms moving forward. Big win for the writing craft. If only we could secure that for the artists too.",

For this current generation the last one was \"The Misadventures of Flapjack\". An absurd chunk of recent US animation can trace itself back to that one show.   \n\nNow, TV animation in the 60s and 70s was generally awful for economic reasons. As things progressed quality could start improving because this was figured out, leading to the toy era of the 80s. Enter... I don't know how to begin describing... Ralph Bakshi. Rotoscope Lord of the Rings Ralph Bakshi. X-rated cartoon people are still debating if it's racist Ralph Bakshi. Horny hobbit Luke Skywalker then a gnome pulls out a luger to shoot wizard-Hitler Ralph Bakshi.  \n\nHis studio kept the lights on between projects was TV animation. One of the most successful projects was a reboot of... Mighty Mouse. Alumni from this show would go on to basically change the face of animation forever in hundreds of ways.  \n\nThat's why Mighty Mouse",

If the movement was unintentional, it\u2019s probable that other takes without the same camera movement existed, meaning the director consciously selected the version with the movement. This suggests it was a deliberate choice.\n\nFor example, in *Out of Sight*, there\u2019s a scene where George Clooney\u2019s character talks to Luis Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s character about an upcoming prison break. During their conversation, Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s character mentions the fence extension, and the camera rack focuses from Guzm\u00e1n to the fence, holds for a moment, and then racks back to Guzm\u00e1n. Initially, the intention may have been to insert a cutaway shot of the fence, but director Steven Soderbergh liked the rack focus within the single shot and decided to keep it.\n\nThis kind of moment is often referred to as a \u201chappy accident\u201d.",

This is called serendipity, or an unplanned fortunate discovery.\n\nAnd not just camera movements, either. Throw-it-in moments where an actor does something randomly because they forgot their lines is also a great example.\n\nGoing back to the example of Home Alone, the scene on the airplane where Kate realises Kevin wasn't with them is an example of this. Kate's suddenly bolting forward and screaming Kevin's name was because Catherine O'Hara forgot her lines, and in doing so is responsible for one of the film's most famous scenes.\n\nAnother fine example of this is in Conan the Barbarian. Due to the fact that his English wasn't otherwise up to par at the time (and after his bad experience being over-dubbed on Hercules in New York which caused him to forbid being dubbed over), Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't actually talk a lot in that movie; he was cast because he looked like he came right out of a Frank Frazetta oil painting. They made it work by having him come across as the battle-hardened warrior that Conan is described as in the books who hardly shows his emotions, and use set designs and long scenery shots for spectacle instead.\n\nAnd going back to camera tricks, one of the most famous scenes in *Requiem For A Dream*, where Ellen Burstyn's character talks about her desire to lose weight and become an actress. During the scene, the camera sways off to the side slowly; when confronting the cinematographer who was in charge of the camera, director Darren Aronofsky found out that he let the camera go out of control because he couldn't see... because he was crying so much that he fogged up the view lens.\n\nThey kept that take in, by the way.",

I wouldn't say the costumes in *Holy Grail* are all that noteworthy, but they have some small touches that complement the film, like the peasants covered in grime, the hinged door on Bedevere's helmet, the 3-headed knight's tunic. They're quite simple but nonetheless effective from a comedy standpoint, but also effective in differentiating heroes and villains, like you can tell Arthur is a good guy with his white tunic with the sun insignia compared to the Black Knight with his helmet obscuring his eyes and a blood-red boar on his chest. \n\nTry to find *From Camelot to Spamalot* by Megan Woller, maybe it discusses costuming.\n\nGood luck!",

The first time Alma acts as one of his models, she's not given any special treatment, or position in the line-up. In fact, she's just modeling \"Dress #20.\" It's the detail of this dress that is meant to nudge us into thinking about her thinking: That is, how this new role is little different from when she first met Woodcock, and was serving him as a waitress.\n\nNote her restaurant-wear:\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/DXob2JpV4AAiE7V.jpg\n\nThen check out how Woodcock first dresses her when he puts her to work modeling his clothes:\n\nhttp://focusmicrosites.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/uploads/post_marquee_5a469396a1bdc.jpg\n\nhttps://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/ccc-uploads/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/29103844/Phantom-Thread-11.jpg\n\nNote that he's dressed her in the same color as her waitress outfit, with the same sleeve length with white cuffs, as well as a white collar and, on the gown, a lace front piece that is just like an apron.

Here are my options as I see it: \n\n1. Buy the VHS like a freak and enjoy it on your VHS player (or I guess DVD if you must (or wait\u2026 do you have a laserdisc player? Buy the laserdisc, for goodness sake!)). But see I don\u2019t like buying things.\n\n2. Scour the internet for a rip. YouTube often has films that come and go depending on how strictly the copyright is being enforced. I\u2019ve also had a lot of luck finding very obscure films on the internet archive (but it\u2019s a bit harder to search\u2026 which is probably why they evade copyright a bit longer than YouTube). But these rips are often of questionable quality and I like my films pristine\u2026 you know, like VHS quality pristine. \n\n3. Look to your local public library system. But wait, Knight Moves isn\u2019t available in your local public library system, you dummy. That\u2019s true\u2026 but it\u2019s available somewhere, and that somewhere is my father-in-law\u2019s library system.

Sure with IMax / PLF you\u2019re paying more and popcorn is definitely much more expensive but overall tickets are still reasonable. Whereas everything including the lumber for building sets has definitely gone way up especially in the last few years. So sadly the real solution is probably higher prices or theaters keeping less of the split, so that mid budget films that used to be $30 mil and are now $50 mil can still be made and be profitable. Even The Substance, which was a fairly small movie especially in terms of sets and cast, still cost $17.5 mil, there\u2019s really no going back to what things used to cost.",

You see that some of the cops are very intentionally co-conspiring with the Chief, and even abusing the power beyond what the Chief really wants, while others you see have reluctantly agreed, and then of course there's the reveal that one officer was a secret informant for the paralegal. The movie makes a point to demonstrate how complacency is a huge factor in corruption, that people like the Judge are crucial for the plan to go right, even though in his mind he was staying out of the whole issue. The end of the movie takes this logic and turns it on its head; explaining how the complacent are only really doing whatever they think is being supported by the majority, if it's corruption then they will be corrupt, but if they see the corrupt system being broken down or fought against, then they will just as quickly turn against it. Not everyone is a die-hard villain, and most people are only doing what they think will keep them safe, even if it means hurting other people.\n\n  \nAlso within the movie it was establish that this conspiracy was only county-wide. The moment the State intervenes it's all over, and the State Police were on their way, so there was an element of pressure from that as well.",

Magically speaking it could be a sort of apportioned, self-inflicted humiliation ritual that gains the sufferer (the artwork itself) a new power. We are echoing it right now.\n\nOtherwise, could just be that did not have access to a top-grade visual studio.\n\n\nI can't answer your question, not having seen the film, but a question is the beginnings of an answer.\n\nI can say the word 'heart' is almost 'hearth' and dragons breathe fire.\n\n---\n\n*Story = A Dragon-Heart* ( eat one and you gain access to the Language of the Birds )",

The acting is brilliant and several scenes (\"Silencio\" in particular) belong in the pantheon of early 2000s cinematography. The movie balances nuances with over-the-top weirdness in a delightful way.\n\nReally shows how our perspective and life experience as viewers is part of the movie experience.",

The fact it was a late 90smade for ABC television pilot(with the added last 30 minutes filmed to make it more R rated and menacing) is so nuts. I could see some feeling disjointed given the tone of the movie wildly oscilates from unsettling and cryptic to light hearted and playful...but there's still a creeping menace underneath the surface.\n\n\nThe bizarre 3am \"Silencio\" theater show is one of my favorite scenes too(whats up with David Lynch movies and bizarre theatre curtain song performances?) I also love the whole Diner dream/dumpster witch sequence and the cowboy. So many memorable scenes. The \"Man from another place\" actor from Twin Peaks fitted into a full body prosthetic in that dark room was another headscratcher moment.\u00a0\n\n\nThen you have the dark comedy of the hitman in that office, or that super wtf last act where she starts to lose her mind. The theories that all the good fun and adventurous moments that happen to the the Naomi Watts character is only her mind and consttucted before shes found in the apartment makes the film heartbreaking.

His cut (10%) was enormous compared to everyone else and Burke was stonewalling on turning it over.\n\nThe inside men and others were likely killed because Burke thought they would snitch.

Anti semitism is a huge problem and growing bigger. In the US, we have people marching chanting \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d. Last week there was a march with Nazi flags. Why just last year, over a thousand Jews were murdered in a terrorist attack in Israel. Maybe you heard about it.\n\nIs the government of Israel a bunch of amoral murderous dickheads? Yes. But the main concern of the ADL isn\u2019t to back the Israeli government. It is to fight antisemitism.\n\nAnyway, I am not Jewish, but fuck every antisemitic piece of shit in their fuck hole. They can eat shit and get fucked by their dad and their dog.",

The ADL has become the chief apologist for this divergence. The result is a direct affront to Bonhoeffer's idea of grace as he writes about in \"Discipleship\". I haven't seen the film. I don't think I will. I don't mean that as an accusation against the idea of the film, but as a recognition that I would rather revisit his ideas from he own hand (written less than 100 years ago) then have those ideas framed in a film. These dramatizations of thought often remind me that John Gault's speech was longer (and less succinct) than the entirety of  Fahrenheit 451.",

The T-1000 can be sent back because the events of the first movie (1984) didn't prevent Skynet's creation - it just altered the path to it. Even though the first Terminator was destroyed and Cyberdyne's factory was gone, the remains of the first Terminator were recovered by Cyberdyne Systems, which led to the development of Skynet through a different route (as shown in T2).\nSo Skynet still exists in the future to send back the T-1000, just through a modified timeline. This creates what's called a \"temporal loop\" where:\n\nOriginal timeline: Skynet exists and sends back first Terminator\nThat Terminator fails but its remains help create a new version of Skynet\nThis new version of Skynet then sends back the T-1000\n\nThis is why in T2, they realize they need to destroy all traces of the first Terminator's technology at Cyberdyne to prevent Skynet from being created through this alternate path.",

Every other film follows this same pattern as the IP switched between licensees.\n\n\nWe can define a compelling narrative answer based on Reese telling Sarah Connor that he is from \"one possible future.\"\n\nThis suggests that every time Skynet invents time travel it resets its future by colonizing its own past with a more advanced version of itself.

        "comment_body": "When it comes to Alien and Predator movies, the better question would be: \"Which movies should I skip?\".\n\nAlien and Aliens are far and away the best 2 movies out of both franchises. The OG Predator would be a close 3rd.\n\nAlien 3 has its fans, and I'm actually one of them. Your mileage may vary. Watch it after Aliens and decide for yourself.\n\nAlien Resurection is a garbage cash grab. Maybe worth watching once, if that. It doesn't add anything to the lore, but it doesn't really break anything either, so take it or leave it. It has some pretty decent action sequences, but that's about it.\n\nI liked Promethius, but it's skippable. Same for Alien: Covenant. The lore gets really weird with these 2.\n\nI just watched Alien: Romulus today, and my first impression was mixed. They did a really good job matching the aesthetic and tone, but the cast was.....too pretty. Their look didn't match the tone of the movie or their backstory at all. They also all looked to be about 13 or 14. It was really distracting.\n\nAvP is fun to watch the 2 species clash, but don't expect much out of the story. It actually also kinda soft breaks established Alien lore. \n\nAvP: Requiem is one of the only 2 movies I would hard recommend a straight pass. That fucking movie is an abomination. Even if you wanted to watch it, the lighting is so terrible you won't know what's going on. Might as well be an audio drama.\n\nYou know what, though? Just consider both AvP movies to be taking place in a different universe. They don't really tie neatly in with either franchise.\n\nPredator 2 is also pretty good, and it's the one that initially ties the 2 franchises together.\n\nPredators is really good. It's criminal that they won't be exploring that storyline.\n\nThe Predator is the other I recommend skipping. It was an attempt to launch a Marvel-style franchise with the Predator(and possibly eventually the Alien species). It's actually offensive to autistic people, features a 10 foot tall mutant Predator, and the epilogue involves the humans getting a Predator-themed Iron Man-style suit of armor. It's fucking trash. \n\nPrey is a solid watch. Really enjoyed this one and I hope the sequels live up to the same standard.\n\nI think that's all of them? Somebody let me know if I forgot one, I'm doing this from memory while avoiding socializing at a Thanksgiving dinner \ud83e\udd23",

I wasn\u2019t even told about it until less than a week before they announced it to the world. I was completely shocked and asked them to please not include the news that I was writing a sequel. They ignored my request and announced it in their press release anyway, seemingly to create a positive spin to their streaming pivot. And so I quietly returned the money they gave me for the sequel. I didn\u2019t want to talk about it because I was proud of the film and didn\u2019t want to generate any unnecessary negative press. I loved working with Brad and George (and Amy and Austin and Poorna and Zlatko) and would happily do it again.

        "comment_body": "I was really excited for the movie based on the trailers, but after watching it, I\u2019m very disappointed. The book was so incredible and the movie did not live up to the story. There were so many facets that were skipped over for unnecessary reasons, and I understand needing to shorten the book to make it into a movie, but there were so many changes that it lost so much of its beauty. A really big thing to me was Mrs V relationship with the family and especially Melody. She was really a guiding force to Melody\u2019s education and her success and such a support to her parents. I also hated the way her mother was portrayed. in the book, her mother advocated so much for Melody and here it felt like she underestimated Melody so much. The relationship with Catherine, while I appreciate that they kept it in the movie, it was so different from how it was in the book. And the bullying was so downplayed that you miss how badly Melody really was treated. Mr. dimming is seen to look like a better guy than he was in the book. You don\u2019t really get to see her experience in the special ed rooms and you miss so much of her interactions and witty remarks with the other kids in the general education class. And there\u2019s Just so many parts of Melody\u2019s character and her story that\u2019s missing.",

If we're just using animation as some kind of crutch to hold onto past successes instead of having genuinely new ideas then that would obviously suck.\n\n\n>Animation opens up limitless storytelling possibilities without tampering with the charm and legacy of these characters. It allows creators to dive deeper into their worlds, explore untold stories, and experiment with bold new ideas\u2014all while maintaining the spirit fans fell in love with.\n\n\nI don't really see how any of this is unique to animation. Now, more than ever, we are capable of creating anything in live action just as much as in animation. There's nothing specific to animation that retains charm or dives deeper or anything else you're suggesting here. In very few cases there might be an actor who becomes synonymous with a role and then ages out of the physical aspects, in which case maybe animation could be some way of extending that. But even then, if the mass audience isn't willing to accept a new actor I doubt they'll readily accept the switch to animation.\n\n\nAt a certain point you have to just move on and do something new. Animation can't change that.",

Otherwise other people haul the equipment, set it up, and operate it.\n\nThe AD, assistant director, handles the logistical side of directing so the director can focus on creative and performance decisions. This is less stressful. As an example, while a director will have input on a schedule, the AD (with their team) then manages distributing that schedule and making sure everyone is lined up for it and shifts things around as needed.\n\nLastly, these guys are all rich and so they can afford luxuries and medicines and foods not only at home but at work that make life easier on an elderly body.\u00a0",
