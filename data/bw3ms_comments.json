Glenda Jackson plays a somewhat mysterious former covert operative of unknown provenance (possibly MI6) who married, and widowed, well in Salzburg. \n\nBoth films are charming and smart, and both couples have *incredible* chemistry. Also note that while these films are older, the women characters are strong, independent, and smart and do not need, or receive, any *saving*. \n\nThe couples are equally matched opponents and essentially start falling for each other due in large part to mutual respect and admiration.",

In Citizen Kane, Rosebud is fundamentally important to the entire meaning of the film. It represents the innocence he lost and could never get back.

I have genuinely never been more terrified of a found footage movie in my life and it has an amazing story to go beside it. I've watched that movie like 10 times this year alone due to how many people I showed it too and literally all of them loved it. \n\nThe rest of the Hell House series is kinda doo doo maybe except the first one but still **The Carmichael\u00a0Manor** is fantastic. \n\nOther good options are **As Above, So Below** \\- **Gonjiam Asylum**, - **Grave Encounters** \\- And if your feeling a little bit on the relaxed side **What We Do In The Shadows**, not really a horror per say but still a fun watch.",

She keeps contorting her mouth in strange ways to the point where I wondered if she\u2019d just had dental surgery. It was super awkward looking.\n\nRoad House (2024) - you will read reviews about how everyone\u2019s acting is off. Everyone comes off as so unnatural, it\u2019s bizarre. I did not like or finish this movie but you may pick up a lot watching this one.\n\nI\u2019ll try to think of movies I loved with some acting I disliked but tbh I don\u2019t often notice acting I think is bad.

I think Tarantino has brought the movie up in interviews before as an influence on his own work. ***A Clockwork Orange*** and ***2001*** are probably my picks from Kubrick, but I suppose most people would choose ***The Shining.***\n\nIf you want to watch a lesser known Scorsese picture that's a little different than his usual work check out ***After Hours.***\n\n***Blade Runner*** is a sci-fi movie that's had a ton of influence on all sorts of movies and video games since, but ***Alien*** is certainly worth watching as well. ***Black Hawk Down*** is an excellent more modern war movie with a great cast. Ridley Scott has only made a few movies that I didn't like so much. I'd only suggest staying away from ***Prometheus.***\n\nI'd agree with the people that have suggested Guy Ritchie has done some good work. ***Snatch*** and ***Lock, Stock*** are two of my favorite movies.\n\nDavid Fincher has made some great films. ***Se7en*** and ***Fight Club*** being my two suggestions.\n\nIf you don't mind watching foreign language films check out Thomas Vinterberg's ***The Hunt*** and ***Another Round.*** They both have Mads Mikkelsen in them.\n\nAnd Akira Kurosawa has influenced a lot of filmmakers. Personally, I like his movies ***Ikiru*** and ***High and Low,*** but most people would probably suggest ***Seven Samurai*** or ***Rashomon***",

        "comment_body": "ok, 3 things:\n\n1. I'm not sure this is the sub for this conversation, since you are not technically requesting films, from what I'm seeing?\n\n2. This is a very common viewpoint, and it is not easy to deal with. Let me ramble for a sec. Everything that is said is said with a purpose, ideally. So, when you say that all stories have been told, what's the point of saying it? are you insinuating that all creation is useless, since it has already been created? are you saying that we should not bother ourselves with originality, since it is impossible to achieve? are you arguing against clich\u00e9? inspire someone going through artist's block?\n\nUsually when talking about art there are two viewpoints one can take: the artist's and the audience's. Saying something like this can mean \"learn about the history of the story you are trying to tell: look at the errors and the successes of old romeo and juliet stories and let that inform the romeo and juliet version you wanna tell\", it can mean \"son't bother, someone already did it better\". Saying this to an audience can mean \"look for the building blocks; learn how to read a story so you can properly see what this movie is telling you to see\" (west side story is romeo and juliet, it is also a story about poverty, immigration and inequality; hell, the original one is a story about racism and the spielberg one is a story about gentrification. But they are both the same story).\n\nAlso, lots of assholes use it. Out of context you see a lot of edgy critics, the nihilism of aesthetic criticism, being like \"what's the point? every story has been told\". This for me is useless at best, embarrasing at worst. It gives person who wants to sound smart but does not care enough to think things through (the worst kind of intellectual, the bad faith one). \n\n3. If you're actually looking for more examples: look up the heroe's jurney (campbell) to find the building blocks of epics: harry potter, Star Wars, Dune, Lord of the Rings, chronicles of narnia etc. Shakespeare's stories are also something we see time and time again. But also, don't get too caught up in this, each movie is it's own universe and you gotta meet it where it's at.",

There are so many examples of stories that have the same common theme but are completely different.\n\nThelma and Louise, Smokey and the Bandit and Road Trip are all road based movies where they encounter obstacles on their trip.   \n\nAll\u2019s Quiet on the Western Front and Platoon are both war movies where a young man faces the realities of war and is changed.",

He means we can classify every story into one of them. \n\nCan we still have an original movie? Yes. It's more about how you tell the story.\n\nBecause all of these story types were 'pre-told' in literature long before movies existed.\n\nFurthermore, genres are ever-evolving. Science Fiction didn't really exist until the industrial revolution brought technology to bear on society. Cyberpunk didn't exist until the 60s.\n\nSo I don't think that was meant to discourage new filmmakers. It was meant to point out the relationships between film.\n\nLastly, you should also investigate Hero With a Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell.\n\nLuke Skywalker/Harry Potter/Paul Atreides/Frodo Baggins is a young boy living a dull life when something happens, he becomes embroiled in greater affairs ultimately developing into the chosen one to save the world. George RR Martin knew full well about this and so developed Arya Stark as a variation that made the hero female and less of an obvious focal point. A similar argument could be made for Jon Snow.\n\nBut this is a story humans have been telling for thousands of years. And yet we still enjoy it, at least a well-told version of it.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces",

Also, lot of the titles (like Donnie Darko, the Prestige, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) were *extremely* popular and well-known to Gen X and Millennials, but Gen Z might not have heard of them as much so they think they've stumbled on a hidden gem and want to make a post about it.\n\nAt least, that's my theory.",

I don\u2019t think it falls back on tedious and depressing gay tropes. Torchsong has depressing themes. Birdcage has a depressing theme but it\u2019s overcome at the end. Cinema has a real problem with including themes of prejudice, hate, intolerance, addiction, sex addiction, and disease in gay films. There are LGBT students at the school in Wicked, but they\u2019re portrayed as bullies, and the homoerotic tension between Glinda and Elfelba is just speculation, with Elfelba being jealous that Glinda gets the guy\u2026 depressing. The Hours is depressing. Priscilla has scenes filled with bigotry and hate. I can\u2019t think of a gay film where they completely resist falling back on intolerance in some way.",

There are a few that are just happy, mostly Yuri to be honest, and definitely some good series. Not that many movies I guess. Ask or look in the Yuri reddits page if you're curious, there isn't really an equivalent for BL. There are also quite a few live action movies from Japan and Korea, I haven't seen any but some people like them, and they look like they have a fairly positive vibes. A lot of this stuff can be problematic in other ways, but there is stuff that is just good and positive.",

I'll recommend Ju Dou in particular \u2014 it is also set in the 20s, also features Gong Li, is about another woman sold into an abusive marriage, and is another masterpiece.\n\nZhang's \u201cfifth generation\u201d compatriot Chen Kaige is best known for Farewell My Concubine.  That's also historical \u2014 it starts in the Warlord era but covers a good chunk of 20th century Chinese history \u2014 and is a tragic love triangle between two actors and a woman (Gong Li again).  The concubine in the title is actually a role in the opera they play, but the woman starts the tale working in a brothel.\n\nMy third recommendation is Ang Lee's Lust, Caution.  That one is set during the Japanese occupation of China during WWII.  I don't know that you'd call the lead woman a concubine, though you might, but the sex here is a lever, a means to an end, which gives it a similar dark tone.",

High-quality versions of all of his movies are all available on the MosFilm youtube channel.  Andrei Rublev (1966) and Stalker (1979) are the other two of his movies that I love most, but they are all fascinating to watch.\n\nSlow-cinema is a catch-all term for a style of moviemaking that Tarkovsky is often linked with. It's a fairly loose descriptor but tends to refer to movies with more methodical pacing and dialogue, where there's a kind of immersion in the lives of the characters, or the philosophical arguments between them, or even just the sheer beauty of the shots themselves.\n\nSome other directors you may like and a movie to start with:\n\nAkira Kurosawa: \\*Ikiru (1952)\\*\n\nTerence Malick: \\*Tree of Life (2011)\\*\n\nEdward Yang: \\*Yi-Yi (2000)\\*\n\nAbbas Kiarostami: \\*Taste of Cherry (1997)\\*\n\nWim Wenders: \\*Paris, Texas (1984)\\*\n\nStanley Kubrick: \\*Paths of Glory (1957)\\*\n\nClaire Denis: \\*Beau Travail (1999)\\*\n\nJoshua Oppenheimer: \\*The Act of Killing (2012)\\*\n\nThere's truly so many incredible movies out there to discover.

Blood Feast (1963) is often considered the first true splatter film.  \n\nI suspect these are the films referred to in your section on \"Video Nasties\", although that's more a term that was applied by the British press in the 80s in reference to the proliferation of splatter films in the home video market.  But the films had a history in grindhouse and drive-in theatre before that period.",

It's not as graphic, but the first cinematic beheading might've been in *The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots* (1895), a movie from the 1800s. *Eraserhead* (1977) probably deserves a mention. If you're interested in the history of cinematic violence, I would recommend checking out the [Mohs Scale of Violence Hardness on TV Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/MediaNotes/MohsScaleOfViolenceHardness). It's an imperfect way of measuring things, but it does provide release dates, so one can see when the movies came along and thus which ones stand out for their initial time period.",

Little by little a picture of a case emerges, as well as the profile of the woman you\u2019re watching being interviewed. The whole thing is wrapped in a fictional database interface and runs on pretty much any device. The whole thing hinges on Viva Seifert\u2019s performance as the interviewee, and she\u2019s unreadably great.\n\nIt\u2019s incredible both as a game and as a piece of video crime fiction.",

Yes, even for adults.\n\n\"Exodus: Gods and Kings\" (2014) is about Moses as well but it's not great imo. Way too dramatic and doesn't really show how Moses is described in the Bible, but you might like it.\n\n\"Ne Zha\" (2019) is a well-received movie about the Chinese mythological character Nezha. Not really a fan of the animation style, but maybe you will like a movie related to Chinese myths.",

Obviously the world and cinema has changed in comparison to 30 years ago, and so did the intended audience. If you go watch a new movie already with pre disposed bias towards what the \"classic romcom\" is, you'll never enjoy them. Also take in account nostalgia glasses, and that the romance market nowadays is geared more to younger folks than the 90s where 30 somethings were easily the main characters, which obviously changes the tone and plot of the movies.    I've watched 15 of the 22 movies I recommended and, do they have the 90s feel? No, but they're enjoyable in their own right, and if I wanted meg Ryan, Id go straight to the source. The same way 2000s tone of comedy died or sci fi isn't what it used to be\n\nAdditionally, if she's not into modern romcoms and has watched 90s romcoms, look into old Hollywood! Billy wilder is great and \"it happened one night\" was made 90 years ago yet has all the romance characteristics we see to this day, truly the blueprint",

Male vanity in some ways, but perhaps more just ego?

If you dug \"Jarhead\" and \"Fury,\" you might wanna check out \"Saving Private Ryan\" for that intense battlefield vibe, and \"Black Hawk Down\" for more military action. Both are pretty gripping! \"Zero Dark Thirty\" is another great one if you're into the whole intense, gritty military scene but with a modern twist. Plus, watching these could turn movie night into a mini marathon of badassery. Enjoy the action-packed bonding time! \ud83d\ude04",

Eyes Wide Shut is somewhat controversial but it does a similar thing where it makes you feel like the universe is imparting secrets on you...like you've seen behind a curtain you weren't supposed to.

It was one of the worst things I've been through.\n\nI am not sure about a movie, but I found the major things that helped me were large doses of Ibuprofen.  And for the pain that I had, holding cold water in my mouth (not too cold) made the pain instantly go away.  Like a switch went off.  I had a cracked tooth with a slightly exposed nerve, so the cool water would stop the air from hitting it.  But, as my body temperature warmed the water up, the pain would come back.\n\nSo, it started an endless cycle of holding water in my mouth for about 30 seconds, then spit.  Repeat.  It made sleeping impossible, because the pain would be fresh and new each time.  Part of me wonders if just trying to get adapted to the pain would have been better.  I didn't sleep for 2 days at the end.  But, if you get desperate, since you only have to make it to tomorrow, this might help.\n\nThere is also like a 50% chance cold water will make it hurt more, so fair warning.  Sorry it's happening.  Good luck!",

Larger franchises are given more weight (via the square root of the number of films) to reward consistency over many entries while avoiding over-rewarding sheer size.\n\nRanked Franchises\n\n\t1.\tMarvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) \u2013 469.8\n\t\u2022\t32 films | 83% average RT\n\t\u2022\tA massive franchise with impressive consistency across dozens of films.\n\n\t2.\tJames Bond \u2013 338.0\n\t\u2022\t27 films | 65% average RT\n\t\u2022\tWhile quality varies, the longevity and influence of the series elevate it.\n\n\t3.\tHarry Potter/Wizarding World \u2013 249.0\n\t\u2022\t11 films | 75% average RT\n\t\u2022\tThe Harry Potter series\u2019 strength offsets the mixed reception of Fantastic Beasts.\n\n\t4.\tStar Wars \u2013 232.4\n\t\u2022\t11 films | 70% average RT\n\t\u2022\tA mix of highs (The Empire Strikes Back) and lows (The Phantom Menace) still results in a strong showing.\n\n\t5.\tThe Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit \u2013 208.3\n\t\u2022\t6 films | 85% average RT\n\t\u2022\tCritically acclaimed originals and moderately strong prequels hold up well.\n\n\t6.\tToy Story \u2013 196.0\n\t\u2022\t4 films | 98% average RT\n\t\u2022\tNearly perfect, but a smaller size keeps it from ranking higher.\n\n\t7.\tFast and Furious \u2013 189.6\n\t\u2022\t10 films | 60% average RT\n\t\u2022\tBox-office dominance and fun outweigh the mixed critical reception.\n\n\t8.\tThe Dark Knight Trilogy \u2013 162.6\n\t\u2022\t3 films | 94% average RT\n\t\u2022\tA near-perfect trilogy but ranks lower due to its small size.\n\n\t9.\tThe Godfather Trilogy \u2013 154.0\n\t\u2022\t3 films | 89% average RT\n\t\u2022\tTwo all-time classics are slightly diminished by a weaker third entry and fewer films overall.\n\n\nHaving said all that, my personal favourite would be The Lord Of The Rings original trilogy.",

Pure 80s holiday nonsense.\n\n5. \u201cJingle All the Way\u201d - Arnold Schwarzenegger doing comedy about a Turbo Man toy. Peak ridiculous.\n\nBonus trash tier: Any Hallmark holiday movie.

Also worth checking out its companion piece, Letters From Iwo Jima, from the Japanese perspective.\n\nTriumph of the Will (1935) should probably be on your list if you want to see some very effective Nazi propaganda.\n\nLots of Marvel movies are considered stealth propaganda as the productions frequently collaborate with the U.S. military for use of vehicles and weapons and generally present conservative values in their messaging (preserving the status quo = good, heroic revolution = bad, evil, unpatriotic)",
