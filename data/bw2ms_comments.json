Absolute garbage fire that\u2019s comedy gold.\n\n2. \u201cChristmas with the Kranks\u201d - Peak Tim Allen cringe. Drinking game potential: take a shot every time something painfully awkward happens.\n\n3. \u201cJack Frost\u201d (1998) - Not the horror one, the Michael Keaton snowman nightmare. It\u2019s unintentionally hilarious and deeply disturbing.\n\n4. \u201cSanta Claus: The Movie\u201d - Dudley Moore at his most ridiculous. Pure 80s holiday nonsense.\n\n5. \u201cJingle All the Way\u201d - Arnold Schwarzenegger doing comedy about a Turbo Man toy. Peak ridiculous.\n\nBonus trash tier: Any Hallmark holiday movie. Drinking game rule: drink every time there\u2019s an unrealistic plot or a predictable romance twist.",

Chris Pratt brings charm, the dinosaur action is fun, and it feels like a genuine throwback to the original Jurassic Park spirit.\n\nHonestly, they\u2019re decent popcorn movies if you go in expecting big dinosaur action and not groundbreaking cinema. First one is definitely the strongest - cool premise, some genuine thrills, and it respects the original\u2019s DNA.\n\nThe sequels get progressively more ridiculous, so temper your expectations. But if you enjoy watching massive dinosaurs cause chaos, they\u2019re entertaining enough.\n\nJust treat them like big-budget monster movies and you\u2019ll have a good time. They\u2019re not trying to be high art - just pure dinosaur mayhem.\n\nSkip reading any plot details, grab some popcorn, and enjoy the prehistoric carnage.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b",

Almost has a 1950\u2019s Twilight Zone episode feel. With its main focus being an inanimate object, it\u2019s touch of old world mysticism, and the poetic irony within its stories.

If you're looking for a film with a lot of action and explosions, this isn't the one, but if your looking for a film that will challenge you intellectually, not in a bad way, but make you think, I enjoyed this one. I don't want to give too much away, because it's well worth the ride. [https://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Timothy-Colletti/dp/B0CVV5VYNF](https://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Timothy-Colletti/dp/B0CVV5VYNF) That's my recommendation.",

The Matt Helms movies were so successful and influential that they actually made more money than their contemporary Bond films, and especially the Roger Moore Bond films really had more in common with Matt Helms than the early Bond films. \n\nScream was a meta deconstruction of horror movies while also being a highly effective horror movie in and of itself. This was in many ways a continuation of the deconstruction/satire Wes Craven had started earlier with Nightmare on Elm Street.\n\nAnd Galaxy Quest is a hilarious meta commentary/satire of actors on a cheesy sci-fi show, a love letter to the fans and convention culture that keeps those shows alive, a brilliant satire of those cheesy sci-fi shows, AND the second best Star Trek movie.",

What a peach of a movie. This one should blow your socks if you're looking for a serious, gritty, realistic vibe.\n\nIf you haven't seen Maverick (1994) you should. It's a Comedy/Adventure Western, lighthearted, but an incredibly fun movie with amazing pace and Mel Gibson at his absolute best. This was one of my favorite movies growing up.\n\nThe Quick and The Dead (1995) is a bit more \"corny\"/unrealistic than the ones recommended so far, but still very fun and with an insanely stacked cast (Sharon Stone, Leo DiCaprio, Gene Hackman, Russel Crowe) having all the fun in the world.",

After *Die Hard*, he was the bad guy in *Quigley Down Under* (evil Australian land baron) and *Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves* (evil medieval official). Both movies are fun and exciting, though of varying quality. Rickman is the easy high point in both.",

Errol Flynn's breakout role. \n\nThe Adventures of Robin Hood. Errol Flynn again absolutely destroyed the role for anyone else to play. \n\nThe Great Dictator featuring Charlie Chaplin as Adolf Hinckel. The scene where he plays with a globe of the world is hilarious in an otherwise serious picture. \n\nHigh Sierra.

For nine-year-old Ren, the last person who treated him with any form of kindness has been killed, and he is shunned by what is left of his family. With no parents, no real family, and no place to go, Ren escapes into the confusing streets and alleyways of Shibuya. Through the twists and turns of the alleys, Ren stumbles into the intimidating Kumatetsu, who leads him to the beast realm of Shibuten.\n\nFor Kumatetsu, the boy represents a chance for him to become a candidate to replace the lord of the realm once he retires. While nearly unmatched in combat, Kumatetsu's chilly persona leaves him with no disciples to teach and no way to prove he is worthy of becoming the lord's successor.\n\nWhile the two share different goals, they agree to help each other in order to reach them. Kumatetsu searches for recognition; Ren, now known as Kyuuta, searches for the home he never had. As the years pass by, it starts to become apparent that the two are helping each other in more ways than they had originally thought. Perhaps there has always been less of a difference between them, a boy and a beast, than either of the two ever realized.",

It intertwines \u201creal life\u201d and classic fairy tales into a fun, funny, endearing, and at times exciting story that *always* uplifts my mood. It helps remind us that there is still some magic left in the world. \n\nOther suggestions:\n\nThe Thing: absolute horror masterpiece.  Yes, it\u2019s \u201cold\u201d, but it doesn\u2019t disappoint. \n\nThe Cabin in the Woods: combines horror and comedy into a fun-filled ride. \n\nEmpire Records: should evoke a certain sense of nostalgia. \n\nShaun of the Dead: horror comedy take on a zombie apocalypse.\n\nThe Blair Witch Project: this one helped shape so many millennial horror lovers.",

It\u2019s hard, I know, movies have always helped me by putting something else to focus on for a bit. \n\nOur mental pathways get deeper, like a path in the woods- the more you go down the \u201cdown\u201d path the easier it gets to be \u201cdown\u201d - but the same is true for going up. I try to shake things up with exercise, a cold plunge (or cold shower), a new experience, or meditation.

Avoid the 2008 Day of the Dead remake though, it's awful. \n\nThe Crazies (1973) also by Romero is not zombies but similar, and the remake is also worth a watch  (2010). \n\nStakeland (2010) is a excellent vampire movie, but they are much more like zombies than \"traditional\" vampires.",

        "comment_body": "I\u2019m a huge fan of the genre, and these are older, but still fit that dark cyberpunk horror sweet spot: \n\nTetsuo: The Iron Man (1989) - Probably the most disturbing cyberpunk film ever made. It\u2019s like if David Lynch directed a body horror movie about a man slowly transforming into metal. Shot in black and white, absolutely nightmarish. Not for the faint of heart.\n\nHardware (1990) - Pure cyberpunk horror. A scavenger finds a robot head in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, brings it home, and... well, let\u2019s just say it doesn\u2019t stay inactive. Claustrophobic, gritty, and mean.\n\nUpgrade (2018) - More recent but nails that visceral feel. Man gets an AI implant that turns him into a killing machine. The action scenes are uniquely disturbing because the protagonist isn\u2019t in control of his own body.\n\nAkira (1988) - The body horror and urban decay aspects might scratch that itch. Neo-Tokyo\u2019s underbelly is proper grimy.\n\neXistenZ (1999) - Cronenberg doing cyber-horror. Bio-ports, flesh guns, and reality-bending games. More organic/biological than traditional chrome and neon, which makes it even more unsettling.\n\nDeep cut: Strange Days (1995) - Deals with black market tech that lets you experience other people\u2019s memories. Gets real dark when a killer starts distributing recordings of murders.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b",

        "comment_body": "* Fantastic Planet (original title La planete sauvage) (1973)  On a faraway planet where blue giants rule, oppressed humanoids rebel against their machine-like leaders.\n* Wizards (1977)  On a post-apocalyptic Earth, a wizard and his fairie folk comrades fight an evil wizard who's using technology in his bid for conquest.  By Ralph Bakshi (Lord of the Rings).  When I was about 12 this movie briefly replaced Star Wars as our favourite movie ever between myself, my brother and two cousins. \n* Heavy Metal (1981)  A glowing green orb that embodies ultimate evil terrorizes a young girl with an anthology of bizarre and fantastic stories.  A bit uneven, but has some great sequences and imagery.\n* Time Masters (original title Les Maitres du temps) (1982)  Piel, a 7 or 8 year old boy, is alone on the desert planet Perdide, only survivor of an attack by giant hornets. Calling for help, Piel's father's friend Jaffar keeps contact with the kid and hurries across space toward Perdide.\n* Fire and Ice (1983)  At the end of the ice age, an evil queen and her son are set on conquering the world using magic and warriors. The lone survivor of a crushed village fights back as does the king of Fire Keep.  The movie is kind of a mess, but the characters and backgrounds are based on the paintings of Frank Frazetta, and animated by Ralph Bakshi (Lord of the Rings, Fritz the Cat, Wizards).\n* FernGully: The Last Rainforest (1992) The magical inhabitants of a rainforest fight to save their home, which is threatened by logging and a polluting force of destruction called Hexxus.\n* Kubo and the Two Strings (2016)  A young boy named Kubo must locate a magical suit of armour worn by his late father in order to defeat a vengeful spirit from the past.  Not technically 2D, but rather stop motion, but I'm including it because so, so pretty.\n* The Breadwinner (2017)  In 2001, Afghanistan is under the control of the Taliban. When her father is captured, a determined young girl disguises herself as a boy in order to provide for her family.\n* Wolfwalkers (2020)  A young apprentice hunter and her father journey to Ireland to help wipe out the last wolf pack. But everything changes when she befriends a free-spirited girl from a mysterious tribe rumored to transform into wolves by night.  You've probably seen it, made by the same people as Secret of Kells/Song of the Sea, but I hadn't even heard of it until about two months ago.\n* The Wild Robot (2024)  After a shipwreck, an intelligent robot called Roz is stranded on an uninhabited island. To survive the harsh environment, Roz bonds with the island's animals and cares for an orphaned baby goose.  Definitely not 2D/hand drawn, but I am including this as well because many scenes look more like water-colours than CGI, plus heartbreaking.",

If you list a few that you both enjoyed it might make it easier to make some recommendations \n\n\n\nI'll throw out some SciFi that is heavy with the dialog but youve probably seen most of these:\n\n\n\nArrival (2016) - Aliens visit earth and a linguistics specialist is on the team to go make contact \n\n\n\n\nEx Machina (2015) - Some rich guy secretly creates an AI and puts it in a robot, he invites one of his employees to come to his remote facility to test it\n\n\n\nCoherence (2013) - Some friends get together for a dinner party on a night that a comet is passing close to the earth which causes some weird events to happen \n\n\n\nContact (1997) - This is basically interstellar before interstellar but not set in space, very philosophical movie\n\n\n\nAniara (2018) - A massive commerical space ship is bringing passengers to Mars but gets knocked off course and they are drifting away from the solar system. I remember liking this but I don't remember if it's super tight plot wise though, all the other films have a pretty tight plot",

The laconic narration of events by a world weary, cynical private detective is practically a cliche.\n\nSome classics of the genre:\n\n* Sunset Boulevard (1950) A screenwriter develops a dangerous relationship with a faded film star determined to make a triumphant return.\n* Double Indemnity (1944) A Los Angeles insurance representative is seduced by an alluring housewife into a scheme of insurance fraud and murder that arouses the suspicion of his colleague, a claims investigator.\n* Gilda (1946) A small-time gambler hired to work in a Buenos Aires casino discovers his employer's new wife is his former lover.\n* The Third Man (1949) Pulp novelist Holly Martins travels to shadowy, postwar Vienna, only to find himself investigating the mysterious death of an old friend, Harry Lime.\n* Murder, My Sweet (1944)  After being hired to find an ex-con's former girlfriend, Philip Marlowe is drawn into a deeply complex web of mystery and deceit.\n* D.O.A. (1949)  Frank Bigelow, told he's been poisoned and has only a few days to live, tries to find out who killed him and why.\n\nSome modern noir that use the trope:\n\n* Brick (2005)  A teenage loner pushes his way into the underworld of a high school crime ring to investigate the disappearance of his ex-girlfriend.\n* Sin City (2005)  An exploration of the dark and miserable Basin City and three of its residents, all of whom are caught up in violent corruption.\n* Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005)  After being mistaken for an actor, a New York thief is sent to Hollywood to train under a private eye for a potential movie role, but the duo are thrown together with a struggling actress into a murder mystery.\n* The Nice Guys (2016) In 1970s Los Angeles, a mismatched pair of private eyes investigate a missing girl and the mysterious death of a porn star.\n* Fight Club (1999)  An insomniac office worker and a devil-may-care soap maker form an underground fight club that evolves into much more.\n* American Psycho (2000)  A wealthy New York City investment banking executive, Patrick Bateman, hides his alternate psychopathic ego from his co-workers and friends as he delves deeper into his violent, hedonistic fantasies.\n* Veronica Mars (TV Series 2004-2019)  After her best friend is murdered, and her father is removed as county sheriff, Veronica Mars dedicates her life to cracking the toughest mysteries in the affluent town of Neptune.\n* Jessica Jones (TV Series 2015-2019)  Following the tragic end of her brief superhero career, Jessica Jones tries to rebuild her life as a private investigator, dealing with cases involving people with remarkable abilities in New York City.\n* The Naked Gun:  From the Files of Police Squad (1988)  Incompetent police Detective Frank Drebin must foil an attempt to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II.\n* Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid (1982)  Film noir parody with a detective uncovering a sinister plot. Characters from classic noir films appear as scenes from various movies interjected into the story.",

As the scenes shift, locations range from Japan to Iceland to Africa, creating a truly international work.",

        "comment_body": "Well first of all I'd say, talk to your classmates and find out what films they are surprised you haven't seen or think you should watch \u2013 and then watch them together, even. If they're film nerds they'll probably love having someone to recommend movies to. And if any of them gives you crap about it, if they even get close to the word 'poser', well, fuck em :) You're in a class to learn. If you already knew everything there'd be no point being there.\n\nSecond, I'd say look at the movies you already like and look up other movies by those directors. You like The Shining, so check out Stanley Kubrick \u2013 Full Metal Jacket, 2001, Dr Strangelove. You like Fight Club, so investigate David Fincher \u2013 Seven, Gone Girl, The Social Network.\n\nOnce you run out of movies to watch that way, look up films that THOSE directors loved and do the the same thing. Shortly after Kubrick died, his daughter famously published a list of some of his favourite movies, including Dog Day Afternoon, The Spirit of the Beehive, and White Men Can't Jump. I'm sure you can find that list online and find a bunch more movies to check out.\n\nLastly, I'd say don't worry about it too much. Not every movie can be for everyone, and you're under no obligation to watch everything \u2013 there are movies by some of my favourite filmmakers that I've still never got around to watching, for one reason or another. If you're planning to make movies yourself, then watching widely can be a good idea \u2013 it will give you ideas, expose you to new influences, broaden your mind and so on. But there's no single right way to go about it.",

This is one of the best ever movies about competent professionals using their specialized skills/working together in order to solve a goal. Also the original *Ocean\u2019s 11 (1960)* is really good too, it doesn\u2019t end quite the same as the Pitt/Clooney one. If you\u2019ve already seen those, here are some other suggestions, you\u2019ve probably already seen a lot of them but just in case:\\\n\nZodiac (2007) - Based on true events, this film follows a cartoonist and a pair of journalists as they investigate the Zodiac killer in San Francisco during the late 1960s and 1970s.\\\n\nHeat (1995) - While primarily focused on the cat-and-mouse dynamic between a master thief and a dedicated detective, the film showcases the skills of both sides in a high-stakes game of crime and justice.\\\n\nThe Bone Collector (1999?) - A quadriplegic detective, played by Denzel Washington, teams up with a rookie cop to track down a serial killer, using his expertise and knowledge of forensic science.\\\n\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) - A journalist and a skilled hacker team up to investigate a decades-old disappearance, uncovering a deeper conspiracy along the way.\\\n\nThe Italian Job (2003) - A team of thieves plans a heist to steal gold bullion, utilizing each member\u2019s unique skills in engineering, driving, and technology.\\\n\nThe Social Network (2010) - This film follows the creation of Facebook and the collaboration of several individuals with different skills, showcasing the challenges and conflicts that arise.\\\n\nInside Man (2006) - A skilled bank robber executes a meticulously planned heist, and a detective must use his own expertise to negotiate and resolve the hostage situation.\\\n\nLogan Lucky (2017) - A group of friends plan a heist during a NASCAR race, each contributing their unique skills to pull off the elaborate scheme.\\\n\nThe Imitation Game (2014) - This historical drama tells the story of Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his team of mathematicians and cryptanalysts who work to crack the Enigma code during World War II, showcasing their intelligence and teamwork.\\\n\nA Few Good Men (1992) - This courtroom drama revolves around military lawyers (Tom Cruise and Demi Moore) who must uncover the truth in a high-stakes case involving a murder at Guantanamo Bay, demonstrating legal procedural methods and sharp intellect.\\\n\nThe Big Short (2015) - Based on true events, this film follows a group of investors and financial experts who predict the 2008 financial crisis and use their knowledge to profit from it, showcasing their analytical skills and understanding of complex financial systems.\\\n\nSpotlight (2015) - This film follows a team of investigative journalists from The Boston Globe as they uncover a scandal involving systemic abuse within the Catholic Church, highlighting meticulous research, collaboration, and determination.\\",

It has the same wondrous exploration of a strange and sometimes dangerous setting, just more sci-fi, as well as incredibly human characters that experience full arcs. There are 4 seasons that each focus on a new main character. Most of the main characters are children going through classic childhood issues, and they are made to come to terms with them during their journey through the infinity train, and the final season is a bit more lore focused but imo has the most popular main characters of the series.\n\nAnother series that admittedly isn\u2019t that similar to OTGW but that I appreciate in a similar way is the official Don\u2019t Hug Me I\u2019m Scared television series. It also has a subtle development of the environment and develops the characters and refines their relationships in a way I find really enjoyable to watch. I love watching the world be built as the episode flesh it out further and further, in a similar absurd way to OTGW.",

        "comment_body": "[The Last Mimzy](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-last-mimzy) - Follows two siblings after they encounter a stuffed rabbit with telepathic abilities.  The original story was written by the brilliant husband and wife team of Henry Kuttner and CL Moore.  When I watched this in the theater, I though *Every kid needs to watch this film.*\n\n[Enola Holmes](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/enola-holmes) & [Enola Holmes 2](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/enola-holmes-2) - Follows Sherlock Holmes' similarly brilliant younger sister.  It's a passion project from Millie Bobby Brown (El from *Stranger Things*) and is a lot of fun for everyone and *perfect* for teen and pre-teen girls. I\u2019m particularly fond of the fact that all the main characters are flawed and all contribute to solving the cases.  \n\n[Goonies](https://reelgood.com/movie/the-goonies-1985) - A group of kids go searching for treasure, while pursued by a greedy family.  Absolute classic.\n\n[The Princess Bride](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-princess-bride) - One of the best films ever made.  A fun, light fantasy film with brilliant acting, swordplay, and witty dialogue.\n\n[The Rocketeer](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-rocketeer) - One of the best superhero films ever.  Follows a young pilot who finds an ultra-high tech jet pack that allows him to fly without a plane. \n\n[Time Bandits](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/time-bandits) - Terry Gilliam's masterpiece following a young boy who is accidentally dragged into the war between good and evil. \n\n[Labyrinth](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/labyrinth) - Truly phenomenal fantasy film.  Follows a teenage girl (the brilliant Jennifer Connelly) as she tries to save her baby brother from the Goblin King.  \n\n***Christmas oriented films, so the timing is perfect:***\n\n[Terry Pratchett's Hogfather](https://www.justwatch.com/us/tv-show/terry-pratchetts-hogfather) (released as both a miniseries and a film) - One of the best adaptations of Terry Pratchett's works.  To prevent catastrophe, Death must take over for Discworld's equivalent of Santa, when he disappears.\n\n[Gremlins](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/gremlins-1) and [Gremlins 2](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/gremlins-2) - Horror comedy about a boy who brings home a magical pet with two rules: Don't get it wet and don't feed it after midnight.  He breaks both rules and hilarity and violence ensue.  The first is more horror and the second is more comedy, but they both have plenty of both. \n\n[Prep and Landing shorts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prep_%26_Landing) - Fun short films about the elves who ensure Santa's deliveries go smoothly.  There are three 10-30 minute shorts and one ~2 minute short.",

Very few films ever sparked an emotion out of me like that one did, especially between the characters and how they meet back up at the end.\n\nIt makes me feel better when times are tough, to appreciate what I have and not take things for granted. Also gives me the notion of hope, Andy dufresne was locked up for a big portion of his life as an innocent man and still managed to remain positive that he would break free one day. The movie being so depressing only makes the ending that more enjoyable.",

Divine intervention, a crucial aspect of The Iliad, is almost entirely omitted, stripping the story of its mystical and fatalistic themes.\n\nHmm I don't think that they do it for accessibility. I think Petersen wanted to tell a human, realistic story and made the conscious creative choice to make a \"secular\" or \"atheistic\" film, like, \"maybe this is what actually happened\". I don't think it loses depth at all. I liked that quite a bit about the film, I remember. I don't think I could've taken it seriously if you had Athena chatting around wtih Hermes or something.\n\nI really liked this movie back in the day, must have seen it a number of times.",

There are hidden trampolines, harnesses, etc.\n\nSo stylistically, it\u2019s going to be more like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and less like Bruce Lee.  King Hu had a painterly vision, so it's not going to be schlocky or goofy \u2014 his editing and camerawork is, I think, consistently elegant and tasteful.  But he was inventing whole new swaths of martial arts filmmaking, and they hadn\u2019t worked all the kinks out yet.  The movies you like are as good as they are because they could watch King Hu films and harvest the best ideas and discard the ideas that weren\u2019t as effective.\n\nBut really, I think the thing that might hold you back on A Touch Of Zen is that it's long, slow, and philosophical; it's 3 hours long, with like an hour of setup before any martial arts?  My recommendation would be to watch his Dragon Inn (1967), which is also one of his 3 best films, and is much shorter, clearer, and more accessible.  Then you can decide if you like King Hu in only 1:45 instead of 3:00!",

The direction from Mike Nichols (who also directed The Birdcage) is spot on and the score from Thomas Newman is perfect. I think you would really enjoy this, it's won a number of awards. It also stars Al Pacino, Patrick Wilson, Meryl Streep, Emma Thompson (to name just a few). https://www.justwatch.com/us/tv-show/angels-in-america\n\nGood luck with the surgery!",

Here are just a couple thoughts based on the trailers for each movie.\n\nDepending on the size of your tv screen, it might be cool to see the detailed artistry of the stop-motion (clay-mation?) in Memoir of a Snail on the big screen...on the other hand, based on the trailer, Anora also seems to have very beautiful cinematography and seems to have an infectious, frenetic energy (classic Sean Baker) that might be more fun to be surrounded by on the big screen. In contrast, Memoir of a Snail seems to be a bit more intimate and sentimental which could be cosy to watch at home/during the upcoming holidays (although it might be a while before it's streaming). Both seem to have an endearing frankness.\n\nIf you need subtitles for the British English of Memoir of a Snail, that could be a consideration. Anora has some lines in Russian, which are automatically subtitled ofc.",

If someone can remember the name of it, that would be great.\n\nEDIT: Crap ... it's not a Christmas movie.  It's \"All Summer Long\" with Autumn Reeser and Brennan Elliott.  And he is her ex and she hires him as the chef.  Still, it's enjoyable if you want to check it out.",
