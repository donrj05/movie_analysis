        "comment_body": "The problem with what you're talking about is another issue similar to what I've seen with people starting a streaming service that's only available in one country then blaming that service when they can't cancel unless they do it before leaving the country. It's a 1d10t error, aka user is too lost in their own little world to do what should be a simple effort to check before leaving/joining a service and make sure it's joined/left while in the correct country. Also similar to the \"I'm spending 2/3rds of my time outside my 'home location' for Netflix, and travel to too many countries to have the 'travel' feature apply to all the areas for my usage.\" It's not on the streaming service to do what should be easily done by the user, it's not on them to offer anything beyond one country/location as a user's service area, it's not required they offer downloads even if the tier of streaming says that's a feature. If you're too dense to pay attention to what version you're signing up for or checking your bank account every month to see if you're paying for the right version, that's on you.  \n  \nThese are all 'optional' extras offered on what is not legally required to offer anything beyond streaming shows at a single region/country for a single set of users. Hell even the 'streaming shows' isn't a legal requirement as these are private businesses we chose to sign up for and agree to EULA/TOS that is subject to change that we're warned plenty of time ahead. Also seeing a bunch of folks on Netflix and a bunch of other streaming service not understand how a lot of other things work either. 99% of the time any licenses rotate every month, meaning any show or movie, on either platforms that do say or don't say 'this is leaving soon', will lose things. Even programs that were owned by that platform at one time. The licenses required to keep those on the platforms when there's other partial owners mean it's easier to just license it out to someone else who's willing to pay to cover part of those costs. Plus they can be just cheap a-holes who want to save paying the folks who made the programs and will just pull the shows and movies. So you have a limited time to watch every single thing you see on the platform.  \n  \nPlus there's limitations to every single one of them depending on what version you're using. Ad based netflix doesn't allow casting, depending on where you're located ad based netflix licenses don't allow certain programs to be played with ads, including netflix exclusives because of the other owners. Also things that had features one week might not have them the next, saw someone who was casting European football on Peacock but it stopped working, and they somehow thought it was required it be offered when licenses can restrict that on one particular set of programs as well. Same reason why Peacock had such crap offerings for Olympics and so many other sports, because it was one of the many 'some items that have ads' programs because they paid for part of the licenses, and those licenses only allowed Peacock to hold the replay rights for short periods of time, quite varied depending on the particular event.\n\nJust like any captions/subtitles you're seeing are not required by any laws, yet I've seen users on netflix who want to see both their language and a friend's language as a caption on a program they're watching so both can see stuff that isn't translated on the other caption/sub. In the US any 'caption' requirements for the ADA only apply to things that are or were ever shown on cable/satellite/OTA TV, streaming platforms don't have to do jack squat for captions or subtitles beyond translating the language being spoken, it's another 'bonus' to attract a larger customer base. So they don't have to offer more then a single language to the customer base beyond the original on things that are dubbed, don't have to have any subtitle/caption languages on that audio track beyond the single language being spoken or translated. Some of the other niche streaming platforms aren't allowed to offer anything except a limited number of languages and captions/subtitles even depending on where they're located, so you have to know what you're signing up for to some extent before you sign up.",

Netflix is a stain on movies in general. \n\nTheir goal is to make theaters go out of business - they could make *real* money by putting this in theaters but consider it not worth it because they don't own the theaters. \n\nNetflix is acting like studios in the 1930's in all the worst ways.",

Like countless villains before him, the film\u2019s central character, Mr Reed, has an inflated ego, a charismatic disposition and a murderous, misogynistic penchant for luring young women into his house and inflicting psychological and physical harm on them. \n\nYet whilst creepy man imprisoning and torturing female captives in his basement is hardly a new trope in the horror canon, I left the cinema feeling oddly refreshed after watching Heretic.\n\nBeneath all the sadism and savagery, the film offered something that I have rarely seen on screen within any genre \u2013 least of all horror: a depiction of young, religious women that was, unexpectedly, both invigorating and validating to watch.\n\nRead more here: [https://inews.co.uk/culture/film/religious-woman-heretic-made-me-feel-seen-3363189](https://inews.co.uk/culture/film/religious-woman-heretic-made-me-feel-seen-3363189)",

The browser UI isn't much better, just replacing the 'my netflix' with the classic my list, new and popular, and a 'new' browse by language option.

Why not test THE ONLY physical evidence in this case. I'll tell you why.......because that implant is nothing more than a curled up resistor. Almost every electronic device in those days had them. Google it \"Resistor\". There's your alien implant right there. Liars get caught eventually. And when they do, they aren't happy about it.

When this popped up on Netflix I thought 'Wow I haven't seen an abduction story in YEARS.' But that's because it's probably easily explained ...\n\nNot one person in this documentary mentions Sleep Paralysis. This is evidently the reason why MANY people have thought there were ghosts or even demons in their house over many years ... and then eventually some thought there were aliens.\n\nSame experiences with creative minds that use cultural and religious narratives to explain their terrifying, paralyzed nightmares. Sleep Paralysis is well documented in science (if not fully understood) and reddit has MULTIPLE stories of people experiencing Sleep Paralysis. They're amazing stories. People often start out stressed and sleep deprived and then they wake up but their body isn't fully awake ... \"hypnopompic ('upon awakening') hallucinations\" [https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/hypnopompic-hallucinations](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/hypnopompic-hallucinations)\n\nPeople have them sometimes once or even multiple times throughout their life and it's terrifying.  \nYou wake up and can't move. Often you feel something pressing on your chest so you can't breathe.  \nYou can look around your room and sometimes hallucinate.  \nPeople describe ghosts at the end of their bed, demons, dead family members (one even a dead pet cat), skeletal beings, bright lights, ... sometimes the entities pull at their feet or drag them. They can hear footsteps, screaming, loud noises.  \n... and then they wake and all disappears.\n\nIt just seems many of these 'phenomena' over the years are actually easily explained.  \nBut docs like this one or ENTIRE SERIES of shows on LMN like Celebrity Ghost Stories or The Haunting Of often tell stories that sound EXACTLY like Sleep Paralysis.\n\nSome stories are unique and not easily explained but the alien abduction stories really seem like Sleep Paralysis + cultural narratives.\n\n\\- \"Sleep paralysis, sexual abuse, and space alien abduction\" [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15881271/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15881271/)  \n\\- \"TIL that alien abduction stories are probably based on sleep paralysis\" [https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1eymt1/til\\_that\\_alien\\_abduction\\_stories\\_are\\_probably/](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1eymt1/til_that_alien_abduction_stories_are_probably/)  \n\\- Reddit's SleepParalysis definition: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/f8d1kj/identifying\\_sp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/f8d1kj/identifying_sp/)",

I too thought the science teacher was 1000% gonna be the killer bc he had some creepy infatuation with the kids or something. And I thought instead of trying to save her she was going to try to find out who killed her so she could take the information back to the future to put him in jail. But to be honest it definitely gave 2000's corny teen movies vibes lol. Also so they atr just gonna continue being friends with the killer kid like he's not a ticking tie bomb lol? I think the sister should have just said she was good to let the killer kill her so her sisters  live like at the ladt minute!",

That was heartbreaking. \n\nAlso, a 4 year sentence? 4 years for that?? 20 years of physical and emotional abuse, doing it in front of small children, then lying about it to police and blaming it all on him.

And in turn,  the digital world can be less judgemental than the real world for being different, looking different,  seeing the world different. \n\nThis documentary did a fantastic job showing perhaps those who are not part of the gaming community what a true joy it can be and dare I say that it is more than \"just a game\".",

I was hooked from the first episode.  I think the promotional stuff kind of leaned into it being a comedy - and it is, but it's a black comedy - and Jeff Goldblum being known for humorous characters may have hurt it quite a bit. I thought it was quite funny but it's definitely more of a drama with some *very* dark humor.",

Many negative reviews seem to be from men who thought the story jumped around too much and didn\u2019t tell a coherent story.  Many positive reviews come from women who thought it was simply a horror movie about being a woman (and did some of the best work showing that feeling I\u2019ve seen).\n\nThe whole time I watched it I kept thinking how amazing a job it was doing of capturing the essence of the feeling of being vulnerable anywhere at any time.  Like, it was a perfect scary movie, to me.  I wonder if a lot of it hit a bullseye for women, but for men who haven\u2019t experienced those feelings, it was boring?",

        "comment_body": "As someone quite familiar with Rodney Alcala\u2019s murder spree, I thought the movie did a good job in its dramatization of Alcala and his crimes including the harrowing survival tale of Monique Hoyt and Cheryl Bradshaw\u2019s infamous close call with him on the reality tv show \u201cThe Dating Game\u201d, an event that led to the coining of his moniker \u201cThe Dating Game Killer\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI appreciated that the filmmakers avoided exploitative and gratuitous violence in their depictions of the victims\u2019 murders, all of whom are real people. I disliked the historical revisionism in the film\u2019s depiction of Alcala\u2019s interactions with Cheryl which followed her encounter with him on the show along with the entirely fictitious subplot centering on a made-up friend of real life victim nurse Georgia Wixted. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nOverall I thought the film was good but not great. I\u2019m happy that it introduced many people to Alcala\u2019s horrific crime spree without glamourizing him and that it\u2019s led many to learn about the known victims and survivors who in addition to Monique include Morgan Rowan and Tali Shapiro. I give the movie a 7 out of 10.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nRest in Peace:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n*Cornelia Crilley\u00a0\u00a0\n\n*Ellen Hover\u00a0\u00a0\n\n*Christine Thornton \u00a0\n\n*Pamela Lambson \u00a0\n\n*Jill Barcomb \u00a0\n\n*Georgia Wixted \u00a0\n\n*Charlotte Lamb \u00a0\n\n*Jill Parenteau\u00a0\u00a0\n\n*Robin Samsoe\u00a0\n\n* and to anyone else who had the misfortune of crossing paths with this monster",

Being familiar with his story, I thought overall it was a great watch. As others have said she nailed the suspense of being a woman alone with a man with nefarious intentions. There was a lot of clear Fincher nods, but it felt more like a respect of style as opposed to an imitation. It felt like a mini Zodiac at times. But she was adding her own flavor to it. \n\nOutside of the audience member plot, a lot of that stuff actually happened and it\u2019s terrifying. I think as a first time director she\u2019s got potential. Some flaws but overall a very competent and engaging watch. I only wish they expanded more on Rodney\u2019s depravity.

But I thought it ended rather abruptly; I expected Cheryl or Laura to be involved in his capture but it turns out they had nothing to do with it. And then I started wondering how much of it was true so I started Googling and was disappointed by how fast-and-loose they were with the facts (Like how Laura was an important character in the film, but IRL didn't exist.)\n\nI really wished they had used the actual dialogue from that episode of the \"Dating Game\" because it's widely available online -- instead, they invented this sub-story of Laura getting confident and taking control of the show, which was dumb.\n\nI get the angle Anna Kendrick was going: the rampant misogyny of the time, and how women were ignored by the police for a decade (there were quite a few women who survived his attacks and reported him to no avail). I think that's a clever approach, but think there was so much actual material on that side of the story that Kendrick could've made a more accurate film and still have it from the women's POV.\n\nAnd this might be a little nit-picky... but I'm a fashion history buff (with a particular fondness for the 70s) and so much of the fashion was more early-70s than 1978. I was especially annoyed with that Marcia Brady giant collar, swirly print mini dress Kendrick wore to the show lol.",

The whole movie is an allegory of society, social classes, mob mentality, capitalism, you name it. So you need to interpret the message more than what you are seeing on screen. In case of the kids, for me it's a message that says the adults suffer a lot during their lives, one month being in a good spot, the other living in misery, to give a chance for their kids to ascend to a better social status than them, or they can be the sign of hope that carries them to the bottom of the pit, just to ascend to something better than the whole system. Now this is MY interpretation, you can have another that's completely different or that compliments mine, and that's why I like those movies a lot. You can really think about how society works through these allegories and reach interesting conclusions about it.",

To start, it seems like by the end of each movies what we\u2019re seeing is largely influenced by what the main character is imagining and not what is actually happening in the real world. The first movie is a little hazy in my memory at this point, but I\u2019m pretty sure by the end we\u2019re being shown things that can\u2019t possibly be lined up with in-movie reality. And in the second I\u2019m not sure anything that happened after the head bonk (or maybe even after she poisons herself idk) is an accurate reflection that of what\u2019s really happening. \n\nAnd as the other commenter said, a lot of the movies are symbolic, and I feel like that symbolism gets cranked to 11 near the end of each. \n\nThat all said, I don\u2019t have exact answers for you lol. Just in general saying that not everything is meant to be taken literally.\n\nBut I think a lot of people have questions about all those dancing kids trying to climb the pyramid.\n\nPersonally I didn\u2019t hate the second movie as much as everyone else seemed to. But it did feel a little bit confusing in both the events that took place and the exact variation of the first\u2019s message that it was trying to pass on. They answered some questions but raised a whole bunch of others. Maybe they were hoping for a third movie, but I kinda doubt it will get funded seeing the response to the second compared to the first.",

        "comment_body": "Wait, I need to ask about this networking arrangement because it sounds insane. You're saying the Internet is slow in your country so you have a wifi router in each room. This makes sense, but the only way this would actually speed up your connections is if you're paying for multiple connections to your ISP. Is this the case? This would also mean that no devices on one network could communicate with those connected to a different router*, is this happening?  \n\nIf everything can communicate with each other then most likely you have multiple access points broadcasting separate WiFi networks (or a single network in the case of mesh systems) because otherwise you're paying for each room to have its own connection to the ISP.  This is a much more typical set up and not crazy at all. In this way you have a fully interconnected network. \n\nIf this second situation is the case then this would not cause an issue with Netflix thinking you're in different households; however, in the first situation Netflix would consider these different households.\n\nGlossary:\n\n- ISP: Internet Service Provider (who you pay for Internet) \n- Router: A networking device that separates networks from each other, most typically a public network from a private network (uses IPs such as 192.168.x.x; 172.16-31.x.x, or 10.x.x.x)\n- Switch: A networking device that joins together various devices on a network \n- Access Point: A device that broadcasts a WiFi signal for devices to connect to a specific network.\n- Modem: A networking device that converts signal types (e.g. Digital <-> Analog)\n- Mesh Node: These are sometimes referred to as routers, but technically only one of them is acting as the router and the rest are kind of like repeaters making a single WiFi network. These would be in each room or area of a building where all the nodes can interact with each other in some way. This type of network would also be considered a single household by Netflix.\n\nNote that some of these devices may be \"all-in-one\" type devices, but I'm mostly looking to see if there's actually multiple operating (not-mesh) routers here.\n\n\\* There is professional networking equipment (or tech savvy folks running a server as a bridge) that can bring multiple network connections together, but I typically don't assume most people have access to these kinda things.",

Prime doesn't check their uploads so even if the bitrate is enough if it's uploaded in 240p no one cares to check. I saw an entire movie look like it was recorded with a hand cam because it was that level of quality and the person who posted about it thought it was a problem with prime. No it's a problem with automated uploads that lack human intervention. If it's not a platform original or exclusive expect it to potentially be crap. Plus Netflix is more and more becoming an android and iOS device focused platform. Most updates are focused on those users, with windows PC and the rest being an afterthought. Why the app on PC is just a fancy window to the website now. Any 'extras' they give are on android or iOS, though again other services can be worse.\n\nYou could have a million dollar super computer and it wouldn't mean anything because you're no longer the core customer for this service. Folks with what I mentioned are. The entire streaming ecosystem is slowly moving away from PC users as a focus, but they're also requiring those on android and iOS to use an app or not be able to use it at all. Soon anyone who tries to watch on PC will be told they're not supported, like certain browsers aren't supported for things like Luna game streaming or Chromecast from a browser.",

Peaky Blinders is just as good.\n\nMasters of the Air is a must see especially for aviation and world war enthusiast like me. The technical details, the execution and the drama. Definitely a gem.\n\nPrison Break could be swapped with Peaky Blinders on some days. The only thing that\u2019s keeping it at 4 is its age, hence the video quality and cinematography. It looks really old compare to Peaky B.\n\nBreaking Bad doesn\u2019t need introduction. Could also be my top 2 easily. Just gives me that \u201cold school\u201d vibe especially since the location was set in NM.\n\nHate me for it, but I take into consideration the overall look and feel.

Reaffirmed again that mindset really is the difference between good and great players. It\u2019s not the be-all-end-all but it\u2019s pretty damn close.\n\nI thought it was childish of Anthony to say they underestimated Dallas in the west finals. Also not the truth. You can underestimate for one game, maybe two, but the whole series? This is basically taking credit from your opponent.\n\nI thought Tatum was the most real, someone above said he comes across fake - maybe so, but not to me I just think he is really introverted and contained in terms of what he says but it\u2019s just how he is in my view. He\u2019d rather let his resume speak about him. Polar opposite to Edwards.\n\nI like how they intentionally chose contrasting personalities to show that anyone can be a champion. Sounds like I\u2019m hating on Edward\u2019s but I\u2019m really not, I actually am really drawn to his charisma and he is definitely exciting.

The choice in that instance used to be either upgrade your plan if you're not on the highest tier or kick one of the devices off. We had that issue when sharing with my sister after she was in shared housing with a particular person, I've had Netflix for some time so its been shared most of the time I had it. The whole idea with 'active member' is to allow someone not in the household location to watch elsewhere like it used to offer, so if you're using it or it's been enabled that will be a problem any time that portion of the account is in use.",

They couldn't keep up with the Joneses anymore if they didn't get the full inheritance. Plus, a new heir meant delaying the inheritance another 18+ years so what were they supposed to do in the mean time for money? Get jobs?

He might not have had the accolades on the level of Hulk Hogan but I wouldn't label him just a midcarder. He also isn't above calling someone on their bullshit. He doesn't just go into business for himself and try to protect his own image, he tells his truth without pulling the punches. \n\nI think he is the perfect person to throw into a documentary like this, you get a fresh perspective on another level other than just the big names and stories you usually see and hear. I love to listen to him tell stories, especially in the Dark Side of the Ring episodes he's in. I found myself laughing several times in the documentary saying \"Damnit, I love Tony\" just cause he keeps it real. Tony Atlas and Jim Cornette are the greatest minds of old school wrestling and tales from the territory days in my opinion. I've never met Tony but I would love to sit down and have a beer with him just to listen to his experiences.",

DanDaDan doesn't endorse sexual assault nor rewards the behavior of the characters who commit such acts. We watched the same episode, that alien got his ass kicked hard by Momo, the same teen who could've been a victim.

It also answered questions that I didn't want answered and just created more questions and nonsense where I didn't want it. Of course I want to know wtf the platform even is or where it is, but I don't want to know at the same time so I'm glad that's all a mystery even though they hinted at it maybe being in space or something. I like that it still has a lot of mystery and the semi twist at the end that it was a prequel.

However, it\u2019s interesting because the prequel shows that even when law and order is enforced, it still benefits only a few and many still suffer. The question is which way of operating is better? I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s an objective answer. It all depends on the individual. For the samurai plus man, he preferred the mayhem. In the first movie, it shows how being at the top causes many to look down on the ones below, but what\u2019s interesting is although it\u2019s true in real life that you never know if and when you may lose your position in life, it\u2019s a certainty in the pit.

Interesting how the format was unique to make at times everything seem crowded and confusing, at least I think why it wasnt classic format ratio, I mean the black bars on sides.\n\nAlso I like how the movie was made for different types of people at the same time. Ignoring the actual reveal, not only the red view showed which one is which, but you could also figure it out on your own by subtle hints they made and some quite obvious hits, which I think was a nice touch.\n\nEnding tho left a bit unfulfilled. For fun, lets compare it to The Prestige (2006) - it kinda has 3 parts: not knowing, knowing, and shock of knowing. And so does It's What's Inside - but the last part is so short. The movie was quite short, and it had time to extend a bit the last part and make it more shocking, maybe extend on sister?\n\nAnyway I did like it, it was a time well spent!",

        "comment_body": "The other commenter who mentioned floating point arithmetic is correct, but I wanted to add a bit more context. Floating point numbers are made to be able to represent a huge range of numbers: positive and negative, whole numbers and decimals. Because of the large range that floating point numbers can represent, but the fact that each number is limited to either 32 or 64 bits (there are two formats of floating point numbers), there is necessarily going to be inaccuracies. Not every number is going to be able to be represented perfectly.\n\nYou can use [this site](https://www.h-schmidt.net/FloatConverter/IEEE754.html) to see the decimal value, the actual 32-bit float value stored, and the error that exists between those two numbers. For example, the closest representation for \"11.37\" in 32-bit floating point format is \"11.36999988555908203125\". I think likely Netflix stores floating point numbers as 64-bit floating point numbers, which are also known as double-precision floating point numbers, or \"doubles\". 32-bit floating point numbers are also known as single-precision floating point numbers or \"singles\" or \"floats\". A double is twice as accurate as singles, but inaccuracies still exist.\n\nUsually, the numbers are stored as floating point numbers in memory, but then rounded either to a whole number or to decimal places when being displayed. The issue is just that Netflix's UI didn't round the number before displaying, so it is showing the entire floating point number. It's a small bug that is easy to fix, and will likely be corrected quickly.",

        "comment_body": "well, these were people who were her friends, people who worked w her every day, who loved her.  i thought they did show the bad things she did.  they played a lot of the calls w casey, the bad things she said, the phone sex, how she did a dry run, the fact she arranged for physical contact w casey in the jail, etc.  they showed all the bad things she did.  the reason she comes off being such a sympathetic character is because she really was this sweet person to so many for so long that nobody could believe it.  it wasn't the direction the doc took, they just showed the facts as they were.  a lot of people loved her.  \n\ni think they did a good job of delving into her life, her character, and why she might have done this.  i'm always interested in the how and the why in any crime doc, mostly the why.  i felt this doc did that very well.  the only thing i think was too romantic were the closing remarks by an inmate who felt vicky was his mom figure.  he talked about casey wanting a bass boat w vicky in a bikini and they showed an image of a boat on a lake.  that was too romanticized.  don't forget, the ending to her breakaway w casey was that she got shot in the head.  so no, not so romantic.  \n\npersonally, i was confused as to how they so definitively decided that she shot herself.  if the shot was to the back of the head, isn't that a tough angle?  I can't rule out that casey shot her.  it could have been an accidental shooting, due to the crash and airbags going off when she was holding the gun, she could have shot herself intentionally, or casey shot her.  \n\nin the 911 call, she gets mad at casey, says, we should have stayed at the motel!  then exclaims, Casey! and then the gun goes off.  Made me wonder.  cuz Casey was a runner - he'd run before and gotten into a car chase.  he did shoot at his former gf, shot and killed her dog, and shot at numerous people w/o a problem.  he was pretty casual about shooting people.  had no impulse control.  makes me think maybe casey said we gotta run, she didn't want to do it, they end up in a ditch and caught, she gets mad at him and for the 1st time criticizes him, casey, the domestic violence abuser w/ impulsivity problems and a penchant for shooting people who irritate him, gets mad and shoots her in the back of the head.  he immediately regrets it, because it was an impulsive act,\n\nOTOH, given that vicky knew damn well this plan had about a 5% chance of working long term, she was burned out - maybe she had decided fuck it, i'm gonna do this, it's not likely gonna end well, and if it goes bad, i'm gonna just off myself.  i'm throwing caution to the wind, i'm gonna just do whatever the fuck i want for the 1st time in my life, i'm tired of being the good girl, the responsible one, tired of doing what i'm supposed to do every damn day, i'll go out w/ a bang if it goes sideways.  like this was a kamikaze thing, and she was fully prepared to off herself when it all came to an end.  maybe she was severely depressed for a long time, and casey presented an opportunity for her to go wild and enjoy herself, then go out \"with a bang\" as she told a co-worker.  interestingly, she was what, 56?  that's menopause age for many women.  i wonder if menopause drove her over the edge.  menopause is a crazy time for many.",

But based on the court trials where Lyle testified and based on what his brother and other people said about him, it seems he was quite a kind and mannered person. This show is very inaccurate, and though it has its merits, I don't think it should be watched with the intention of better understanding the real-life Menendez brothers' case. It's based on the case, but Ryan Murphy made a whole lot up. I think Lyle's dramatic and manic persona was mainly just an entertainment factor or maybe it was Ryan Murphy's personal interpretation of Lyle and his unique take on the character, and even though I found it strange, I admit it made him stand out and make some scenes pretty funny.\n\nBasically, it's a Netflix show, and it definitely dramatizes many aspects of the story.",

Lyle played by Nicholas Chavez had both the impulsive, arrogant charm balanced with moments of gentleness and care whenever he\u2019s with his brother. And of course the delivery of the monologue by Cooper Koch was a hard watch because of how emotional and personal it felt.\n\nRegardless, a show about 2 men who are very much still alive and awaiting their freedom requires great empathy when sharing their story to avoid intrusion and false narratives. I\u2019m not sure if that has been fulfilled as the brothers themselves weren\u2019t too happy with the show!\n\nI must say, I did enjoy the soundtrack and styling more than anything else\u2026.",

It just started a few days back.  \nI saw that Netflix recently got rid of my old plan (720p No ads) and replaced it with a new plan (1080p with ads).  Since the new plan works on my PC & phone... It's most likely the software on my Echo Show (from 2018) that is unable to support showing the ads.  So... I guess this is an Amazon problem more than a Netflix problem. And, I'm not willing to upgrade my Netflix plan (to add-free) just for my Echo Show in the kitchen... so I won't be testing to see if going ad-free fixes the issue.  But I suppose I'll report the issue to Amazon and see if they'll support software updates on a 6 year old Echo Show.  Good luck solving your issues!",

Which means if they dont have enough of one kind of chef the returnees just happen to fill that space and make it even again. They have had this basic split each time, so I'm expecting the same until the final 2. Even if 2 of the same color happen to be the best, they will still give a space to the next best of the other color. So it's not fake per se. It just has that wrinkle of necessary overproduction to keep the show on theme.",

I remember hearing a lot of people having issues with the ad plan on Fire tv and it turns out they had first generation devices that could not update to support the Netflix ad plans. It worked after they got a newer Fire stick.",

Hence the point of the show was for us to decide who the monsters were - the kids or the parents.",

The funeral music choice was eerie, the son wearing his dad's shoes at the funeral, all the spending, the urgency to get into the dads safe, etc. it was definitely premeditated. I believe if Lyle and Patrik had laid low, they would've walked away with just manslaughter.",
